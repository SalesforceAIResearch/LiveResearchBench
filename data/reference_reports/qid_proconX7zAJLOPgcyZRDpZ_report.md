# How, and to what extent, standardized tests have improved K–12 education in China, Japan, and the United States since 2020

## Scope and weighting
- Educational level: K–12 (elementary through high school), including high-stakes end-of-secondary/college-entrance exams (China’s Gaokao/Zhongkao; Japan’s Common Test for University Admissions and prefectural high school entrance exams; U.S. ESSA state summatives/NAEP) and low-stakes diagnostics (e.g., Japan’s NAOA; U.S. MAP/i‑Ready; China’s NAEQ).
- Outcomes weighted for evaluation: academic achievement and recovery (primary), equity and achievement gaps (primary), instructional quality and curriculum breadth (secondary), student well-being and motivation (secondary), accountability/system improvement (secondary), and postsecondary transition where K–12 testing plays a role (secondary).

## Findings at a glance
- Since 2020, standardized tests have most clearly improved: visibility into learning loss and subgroup gaps; targeting of tutoring/acceleration; alignment of instruction to higher-order standards; and, in some systems, stability of academic performance (notably Japan).
- Trade-offs have been pronounced: narrowed curriculum time (especially in U.S. science/civics), inequities amplified by prep-sensitive test components (China) or information asymmetries (U.S. test-optional), stress/workload concerns (China/Japan), and data transparency limitations (China’s compulsory stage; Japan’s anti–league table stance).
- The strongest causal gains post‑2020 come when low‑stakes diagnostics are linked to high‑dosage, in‑school tutoring (U.S.). High‑stakes tests by themselves rarely closed pandemic gaps.

| Argument Type | Thesis | Supporting Evidence (2020–2025) | Comparative Insights (China/Japan/U.S.) | Reasoning and Analysis | Source URL(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro | 1) Tests restored visibility and enabled targeted recovery and accountability improvements | - U.S. resumed accountability; states identified more CSI schools, increasing improvement pressure [26]. NAEP 2024 provided comparable national/trend data: Grade 4 math rose vs. 2022 (still below 2019) [1]; 4th-grade reading fell [2]. - Japan’s census-style NAOA covered ~1.86M students in 2024 and flagged persistent weaknesses on description items; results are used for improvement rather than sanctions [7][8]. - China’s NAEQ was redesigned in 2021 to provide early warning, provincial “problem lists,” and multi-domain monitoring; MOE reporting indicated ~80% of students at mid-or-better performance in 2022 [13][14]. | - U.S.: High-frequency public reporting and ESSA accountability created actionable signals for resource targeting. - Japan: Low-stakes, systemwide diagnostics (NAOA) feed PD loops without punitive stakes. - China: NAEQ feeds internal supervision and early warning, though less granular public time series are released at the national level. | Visibility is a prerequisite for improvement. Post‑COVID, comparable, population-level assessments clarified where losses were greatest and which schools needed support. Even with different stakes, all three systems used standardized assessments to surface priorities (U.S.: CSI designations; Japan: constructed response; China: multi-domain quality signals). | [1] https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8; [2] https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8; [7] https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/gakuryoku-chousa/sonota/1419141_00004.htm; [8] https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240729/k10014528361000.html; [13] https://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A11/moe_1789/202109/t20210926_567095.html; [14] https://www.moe.gov.cn/fbh/live/2022/54598/mtbd/202206/t20220622_639748.html; [26] https://www.urban.org/research/publication/rapid-increase-school-accountability-during-pandemic |
| Pro | 2) Low-stakes diagnostics linked to high-dosage, in‑school tutoring produced sizable learning gains | - Multiple large RCTs/scale-ups: in‑school, frequent, aligned tutoring shows 0.16–0.37 SD math effects—roughly two‑thirds of a year of learning—when implemented with fidelity [21][22]. - Texas requires accelerated instruction for students not meeting standards; HB 1416 refines dosage and grouping, explicitly tying state test results to tutoring/acceleration [23][24]. - Tennessee’s TN ALL Corps served 225,000+ students with high‑dosage tutoring targeted by state data [25]. | - U.S.: Strongest causal evidence; tests are triggers for supports. - Japan: NAOA findings inform lesson study and school improvement; less reliance on tutoring mandates. - China: NAEQ used for early warning; “double reduction” shifted support into school-based services rather than private tutoring. | Diagnostics alone do not raise achievement; action does. When interim/state results triage students into in‑school, curriculum‑aligned tutoring, effects are large and consistent—one of the clearest post‑2020 success stories. | [21] https://educationlab.uchicago.edu/resources/realizing-the-promise-of-high-dosage-tutoring-at-scale-preliminary-evidence-for-the-field/; [22] https://educationlab.uchicago.edu/projects/saga-education-high-dosage-tutoring/; [23] https://tea.texas.gov/academics/learning-support-and-programs/accelerated-instruction; [24] https://tea.texas.gov/about-tea/news-and-multimedia/correspondence/taa-letters/accelerated-instruction-hb-1416-overview-and-optional-webinar-opportunity; [25] https://www.tn.gov/education/tn-all-corps.html |
| Pro | 3) High-stakes exams have coexisted with stable or top-tier outcomes, especially in Japan | - Japan maintained high international performance: PISA 2022 above OECD average; OECD highlighted Japan’s resilience during disruption [5]. TIMSS 2023: Japan top‑6 across grades/subjects [3][4]. - U.S.: 4th-grade math ticked up vs. 2022 but remains below 2019 [1]. - China: Gaokao participation remained extremely high (13.42M in 2024; 13.35M in 2025), sustaining alignment to curricular standards [11][12]. | - Japan pairs high-stakes entrance exams with low-stakes national diagnostics; the mix appears to have supported relative stability. - U.S.: Achievement remains mixed; accountability resumed but recovery incomplete. - China: Strong student-level stakes continue to focus secondary instruction. | While causality is complex, Japan’s combination—selective exams plus formative national diagnostics—correlates with internationally strong, stable performance post‑2020. Sustained stakes may help maintain focus on core content; formative data help refine pedagogy. | [3] https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/12_4_2024.asp; [4] https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/first-look-ed-tab/timss-2023-u-s-highlights-web-report; [5] https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/11/pisa-2022-results-volume-i-and-ii-country-notes_2fca04b9/japan_aa63210c.html; [1] https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/mathematics/2024/g4_8; [11] https://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xwfb/xw_zt/moe_357/2024/2024_zt12/mtbd/202406/t20240603_1133631.html; [12] https://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xwfb/xw_zt/moe_357/2025/2025_zt10/mtbd/202506/t20250610_1193607.html |
| Pro | 4) Assessment design and reporting can improve instructional quality by emphasizing higher‑order skills | - Texas STAAR redesign added evidence-based writing and capped multiple-choice at 75% to better align tests with instruction [19]. - Japan’s NAOA repeatedly identifies weak performance on constructed-response items, prompting PD to strengthen “thinking, judgment, expression” [7][8]. - China’s NAEQ broadens monitoring (Chinese, math, science, PE/health, arts, labor, mental health), discouraging narrow test prep [13]. | - U.S.: Redesigns are used to steer instruction toward richer tasks. - Japan: National assessment feedback sharpens instructional focus on reasoning/writing. - China: System monitoring pushes breadth and whole-child competencies. | When tests measure more than rote recall and when results are used in PD cycles, they can lift the quality of instruction system‑wide by aligning teaching to deeper competencies. | [19] https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/assessment-initiatives/staar-redesign; [7] https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/gakuryoku-chousa/sonota/1419141_00004.htm; [8] https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240729/k10014528361000.html; [13] https://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A11/moe_1789/202109/t20210926_567095.html |
| Pro | 5) Standardized scores, used contextually, can advance fairness by revealing talent that admissions might miss | - In test-optional years with “hidden” scores, high-scoring disadvantaged U.S. students who submitted tests saw materially higher admit rates, implying tests can surface overlooked talent [32]. - Multiple selective U.S. universities reinstated SAT/ACT in 2024–2025, arguing scores aid contextualized evaluation [33]. - Japan’s Common Test provides a national anchor that tempers idiosyncratic institutional exams [9][10]. | - U.S.: When paired with context, tests help identify high-potential students lacking other signals. - Japan: A common national signal complements school-specific second-stage exams. - China: Gaokao remains a merit-based gate that can check favoritism, though design choices matter (see Con #2). | Standardized measures, fairly designed and interpreted, can reduce noise, reveal potential among less-connected students, and mitigate favoritism in selection—benefits that are strongest when combined with holistic/contextual review. | [32] https://www.nber.org/papers/w33389; [33] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/20/university-require-sat-act-test-diversity; [9] https://www.dnc.ac.jp/kyotsu/hyouka/r6_hyouka/r6_data.html; [10] https://www.dnc.ac.jp/kyotsu/hyouka/r7_hyouka/r7_data.html |
| Pro | 6) Broadened test domains can support whole‑child outcomes and rebalance instruction | - China raised Zhongkao PE weight in multiple regions (e.g., Beijing to 70 points with process + on-site components), increasing sustained PE and health instruction [15][16]. - China’s NAEQ now monitors PE/health, arts, labor, and mental health alongside academics [13]. - Japan’s NAOA questionnaires and reporting address learning habits and broader competencies [7][8]. | - China: High-stakes lever (Zhongkao PE) shifts time toward health/PE. - Japan: Low-stakes diagnostics and Course of Study stress balanced competencies. - U.S.: Fewer high-stakes levers exist for PE/arts; breadth often depends on local policy (see Con #1). | Expanding what “counts” in assessment and admissions can recalibrate schools toward broader aims (fitness, arts, habits), mitigating over-narrow academic drill and promoting whole-child development. | [15] https://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_xwfb/s5147/202104/t20210419_526999.html; [16] https://www.sport.gov.cn/n20001280/n20001265/n20066978/c26018947/content.html; [13] https://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A11/moe_1789/202109/t20210926_567095.html; [7] https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/gakuryoku-chousa/sonota/1419141_00004.htm |
| Con | 1) Curriculum narrowing and crowd‑out of untargeted subjects | - U.S. NAEP showed historic declines and continued weakness in non‑tested domains: civics and U.S. history fell; science also declined vs. 2019, with fewer students reporting inquiry activities [21][18]. - District recovery strategies (double‑blocking ELA/math) often squeeze science labs, social studies, arts—reflected in NAEP contextual data and media analyses [18]. - Japan and China have policy counterweights (Course of Study; “five educations”), but high-stakes focus can still pull time toward tested subjects. | - U.S.: Strongest narrowing pressures due to accountability tied mainly to ELA/math. - Japan: NAOA is low-stakes, helping preserve breadth; yet entrance exams still channel effort. - China: Zhongkao/Gaokao emphasize core academics; PE reweighting is a notable counterbalance. | When testing and accountability emphasize a subset of subjects, schools reallocate time accordingly. Without complementary policy (e.g., tested portfolios in science/civics or explicit time protections), breadth erodes most where stakes are highest. | [21] https://www.nagb.gov/naep/understanding-nations-report-card-2022-trends-research/civics-and-us-history.html; [18] https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/whats-behind-the-drop-in-students-science-scores-on-naep/2025/09 |
| Con | 2) Poorly designed components and unequal prep access can widen equity gaps | - Adding English listening to Gaokao causally widened urban–rural inequality in college access by ~30%, displacing ~54,000 rural students and ~11,000 from elite admission slots [29]. - Japan’s NAOA analyses link household income and study habits to score differences (higher income → higher correct response rates), underscoring SES gradients [30]. - U.S. large-scale diagnostics show recovery remains “elusive,” with larger unfinished learning in high-poverty schools [18][19][20]. | - China: Component choices (e.g., listening) can disadvantage rural students; double reduction curbed mass tutoring but affluent families substitute to private options. - Japan: Juku and SES-linked differences persist; NAOA surfaces disparities. - U.S.: Diagnostics reveal gaps; intervention capacity is uneven. | Equity depends on design and access. Prep-sensitive items and differential information/tutoring amplify SES/locale gaps; tests can either help target supports or, without safeguards, exacerbate disparities. | [29] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387824000208; [30] https://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/chousa/shotou/074/shiryo/attach/1295631.htm; [18] https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/recovery-still-elusive-2023-24-student-achievement-highlights-persistent-achievement-gaps-and-a-long-road-ahead/; [19] https://www.curriculumassociates.com/about/press-releases/2023/08/state-of-student-learning-2023; [20] https://www.curriculumassociates.com/about/press-releases/2025/07/state-of-student-learning-2025 |
| Con | 3) Standardized testing alone did not deliver post‑pandemic recovery | - U.S. NAEP 2024: 4th‑grade reading declined further vs. 2022; overall levels remain below 2019 [2]; TIMSS 2023 U.S. math down sharply vs. 2019 [3][4]. - Large U.S. diagnostics show stalled recovery by 2024–2025; middle grades lag most [18][20]. - Japan’s NAOA reports continued weaknesses in descriptive reasoning; 2025 coverage noted further declines in Japanese/math averages despite stable international standing [7][8]. | - U.S.: Testing mapped the problem but did not, by itself, fix it; results improved when tied to tutoring/acceleration (see Pro #2). - Japan: Diagnostics guide instruction; some slippage persists. - China: NAEQ expands monitoring; public national trendlines remain limited. | Measurement is not remediation. Absent strong, well-implemented supports, standardized tests inform but do not improve outcomes on their own—an especially clear lesson in U.S. recovery data. | [2] https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g4_8; [3] https://nces.ed.gov/whatsnew/press_releases/12_4_2024.asp; [4] https://ies.ed.gov/use-work/resource-library/report/first-look-ed-tab/timss-2023-u-s-highlights-web-report; [18] https://www.nwea.org/research/publication/recovery-still-elusive-2023-24-student-achievement-highlights-persistent-achievement-gaps-and-a-long-road-ahead/; [20] https://www.curriculumassociates.com/about/press-releases/2025/07/state-of-student-learning-2025 |
| Con | 4) High-stakes pressure has well‑being and workload costs | - China’s 2021 “double reduction” policy explicitly aimed to reverse “score obsession,” cap homework, and curb tutoring; research documents large tutoring declines, improved family well‑being, and increased teacher workload/pressure inside schools [13][17]. - MOE briefings report most students now finish homework in recommended time, indicating prior overload linked to exam pressure [14]. - Japan’s entrance exam culture sustains juku pressures; NAOA flags reasoning/writing deficits, raising expectations on teachers to improve these skills without increasing student stress. | - China: Policy response acknowledges harm from high-stakes prep and shifts burden into schools, with mixed workload effects. - Japan: Longstanding exam culture heightens outside-school prep; government leans on low-stakes diagnostics to improve instruction. - U.S.: Less centralized exam pressure on families; stress often linked to accountability consequences in early grades and to remediation/retention policies. | Systems relying on one‑shot high-stakes signals risk motivating excessive drill and external cram, with mental-health and equity costs. Shifting pressure into schools without additional capacity can raise teacher strain. | [13] https://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A11/moe_1789/202109/t20210926_567095.html; [17] https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20965311241265123; [14] https://www.moe.gov.cn/fbh/live/2022/54598/mtbd/202206/t20220622_639748.html |
| Con | 5) Gaming, cheating, and test‑prep distortion remain risks under strong incentives | - Classic evidence shows measurable cheating under high-stakes accountability (Chicago 3–5% of classrooms) [pre‑2020 context]. - Post‑“double reduction,” tutoring firms re-emerged/rebranded in China, signaling persistent gaming incentives when stakes remain high [31]. - Heavy reliance on multiple-choice formats can invite shallow test‑prep; although states like Texas have moved to richer items, scaling and automated scoring introduce new validity challenges [19]. | - China: Strong student-level stakes + uneven enforcement sustain shadow prep markets. - Japan: Juku market persists and adapts to entrance exam formats. - U.S.: Accountability pressure historically led to teaching-to-the-test; redesigns aim to mitigate but cannot eliminate incentive distortions. | When rewards/sanctions hinge on scores, some actors will game the system. Design improvements help, but incentives must be tempered by broader measures of school quality and careful monitoring. | [31] https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-private-tutoring-firms-emerge-shadows-after-crackdown-2024-10-28/; [19] https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/assessment-initiatives/staar-redesign |
| Con | 6) Transparency and comparability constraints can blunt improvement and fairness | - China prohibited public disclosure of exam scores/rankings at the compulsory stage to curb competition; while protective, this limits external accountability and public analysis of gaps [34]. NAEQ publishes limited national time series [13]. - Japan avoids school-level league tables; 2024–2025 reviews further adjusted publication formats, emphasizing local improvement over public comparison [7][8]. - U.S. test‑optional admissions reduced comparability in college entry; causal work shows disadvantaged high scorers harmed when they withhold scores, complicating equity goals [32]; many selective universities reinstated tests in 2024–2025 for comparability [33]. | - China/Japan: Curbing league tables reduces perverse incentives but can limit external scrutiny. - U.S.: Removing standardized signals at college entry had unintended equity costs; reintroduction aims to restore comparability. | Balancing transparency and pressure is difficult. Excess transparency invites score chasing; too little impedes diagnosis and accountability. The optimal middle ground ties data to supports and contextualized evaluation rather than to simplistic rankings. | [34] https://english.www.gov.cn/statecouncil/ministries/202103/18/content_WS60534c13c6d0719374afb07f.html; [13] https://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A11/moe_1789/202109/t20210926_567095.html; [7] https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/shotou/gakuryoku-chousa/sonota/1419141_00004.htm; [8] https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20240729/k10014528361000.html; [32] https://www.nber.org/papers/w33389; [33] https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/20/university-require-sat-act-test-diversity |

## Comparative synthesis and implications
- What improved: Tests have most effectively improved K–12 education when used as system diagnostics tied to targeted supports. The clearest causal gains come from diagnostic-triggered high-dosage tutoring (U.S.). Japan’s combination of high-stakes entrance exams with low-stakes national diagnostics appears to have supported comparatively stable academic outcomes post‑2020. China broadened the assessment agenda (NAEQ; Zhongkao PE weighting) and curtailed commercial test-prep, rebalancing incentives toward whole-child outcomes inside schools.
- What did not: Standardized tests, by themselves, did not reverse pandemic losses. Without capacity and supports, the U.S. experienced stalled recovery (especially in middle grades). Equity remains fragile: component choices (China’s Gaokao listening), SES-linked prep access (Japan’s juku), and information asymmetries (U.S. test-optional) can widen gaps.
- Design lessons:
  - Pair data with action: Use low-stakes diagnostics to triage students into in‑school, high‑dosage tutoring; tie state summatives to mandated supports (Texas, Tennessee).
  - Measure what matters: Redesign assessments to include writing/reasoning and monitor broader domains (PE/arts/labor/mental health) to avoid over-narrowing.
  - Guard equity in design: Avoid prep-sensitive components; use contextualized review; expand school-based supports to reduce dependence on private prep.
  - Calibrate transparency: Publish enough to enable diagnosis and democratic accountability, but focus reporting on improvement over ranking.
