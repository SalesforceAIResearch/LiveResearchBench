# Evidence-Backed Analysis Plan for the Global Commercial Orbital Space Launch Market (2020–2024)

## Executive Summary

The requested deliverable requires precise, verifiable, year-by-year market sizing, growth metrics, segmentation, and company-by-company competitive analysis with a direct URL for every fact and statistic. The materials provided contain no research findings or sources. To meet the evidentiary standard, live retrieval of primary sources (e.g., FAA AST annual reviews, BryceTech datasets, SIA and Space Foundation industry reports, official agency/contract documents, and company disclosures) is required. The sections below specify the exact data to extract, the methodology that will be used, how disagreements across sources will be reconciled, and the authoritative sources that will be cited.

Key datasets exist and are publicly accessible (or have public executive summaries/press releases with usable figures) that can support the full scope defined in the brief:
- FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) annual Year In Review and Compendium publications for U.S. licensed activity and definitional clarity [1][2].
- BryceTech annual orbital launch reports and launch attempt datasets for global launch counts by provider, country, and customer type [3].
- Satellite Industry Association (SIA) State of the Satellite Industry annual press releases for global launch industry revenues by year [4][5][6][7].
- Space Foundation’s The Space Report for global space economy and launch market context [8].
- UCS Satellite Database for payload purpose and orbit class context [9].
- Primary agency and company documents for contracts, launch counts, performance specs, and program status (NASA, DoD/USSF/NRO/ESA/ISRO and SpaceX/ULA/Rocket Lab/Blue Origin) [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21].

This document lays out the evidence plan to produce the final quantified analysis once source retrieval is authorized.

## Definitions and Scope (to be applied consistently)

- Market definition: “Commercial orbital space launch market” refers to revenues from orbital launch services sold by commercial providers (including launches purchased by government customers). Suborbital launch is out of scope unless specifically called out for context, and will be labeled if used [1][2].
- “Commercial” treatment: FAA AST defines “licensed commercial space transportation” for U.S.-regulated missions; this is not identical to “global commercial launch revenue.” Differences in definitions across FAA AST, SIA, Space Foundation, and BryceTech will be presented side-by-side with citations in the final report [1][2][3][4][8].
- Timeframe: Calendar years 2020–2024. Any 2025+ details will be labeled as context.

## Data To Be Collected and Computation Methods

1) Market size, growth, segmentation (2020–2024)
- Annual global launch industry revenues (USD nominal): Extract from SIA State of the Satellite Industry press releases for 2020–2024; cross-check with Space Foundation and Euroconsult press releases where necessary. If sources diverge, present both with notes on coverage and methodology [4][5][6][7][8].
- Annual global commercial orbital launch counts: Use BryceTech’s “Global Orbital Launch Attempts” reports; cross-check against FAA AST Year In Review (for U.S.-licensed), and agency manifests (e.g., NASA/USSF) where necessary [1][2][3].
- Growth: Compute YoY and 2020–2024 CAGR from the revenue time series (nominal). If inflation-adjusted is requested, apply U.S. CPI-U with base year and method specified.
- Segmentation:
  - Customer type: Government customers purchasing from commercial providers vs purely commercial customers — use BryceTech breakdowns and FAA AST customer categorizations; validate with NASA/DoD/ESA procurement notices (e.g., NSSL, NASA LSP/VADR, ESA Arianespace tasking) [1][2][3][10][11][12].
  - Payload purpose: Satellite internet/LEO broadband (Starlink, OneWeb, Kuiper), defense/national security, other commercial payloads (EO/IoT/infrastructure). Use BryceTech launch payload purpose taxonomies, UCS Satellite Database, and operator press releases (e.g., Amazon Kuiper) [3][9][13].
  - Orbit class: LEO/MEO/GEO/cislunar — derive from BryceTech and UCS Satellite Database payload categorization; supplement with mission press kits [3][9][15][19].
  - Payload mass class: Use BryceTech payload mass distributions per launch/year where available; otherwise derive using provider user guides and public manifest data (flag as estimate if needed) [3][15][17][19][20].
  - Geography: By provider country and by launch site/spaceport — use BryceTech (country/provider), FAA AST (U.S. spaceports), and range/spaceport operators (e.g., Cape Canaveral/KSC, Vandenberg, Wallops, Mahia, Kourou) [1][2][3][14][16][18][21].

2) Growth drivers and barriers
- Drivers:
  - LEO broadband deployments: Quantify launches and payloads for Starlink, OneWeb, and Kuiper by year and share of total commercial launches/payload mass; cite SpaceX, OneWeb/Airbus, and Amazon Kuiper official releases and BryceTech tallies [3][13][15].
  - Defense/national security: Quantify U.S. NSSL Phase 2/3 task orders, mission counts, and launch share by provider; cite USSF/Space Systems Command releases and contract awards [11][12].
  - Other commercial payloads: EO/IoT/in-space infrastructure — use BryceTech payload purpose counts and representative operator contracts (Planet, Spire, Capella, etc.) [3].
- Barriers:
  - Cost: List vs realized price per kg — use official provider list pricing (SpaceX Falcon 9/Heavy, Rocket Lab Electron/Neutron where published; ULA/Blue Origin where available via official statements or SEC filings). Where list prices are absent, use observed contract values from public awards with clear scope/assumptions and note limitations [15][17][19][20].
  - Regulation/licensing/range capacity: Use FAA AST licensing stats, NOTAM/spaceport capacity discussions in FAA Year In Review/Compendium, and range operator statements [1][2][14][21].
  - Technological risk: Vehicle development/transition (Ariane 5→Ariane 6, Atlas V/Delta IV Heavy retirements, Vulcan Centaur, New Glenn, Neutron, Starship testing) — cite agency/company statements and launch status updates [10][12][16][17][19][20].

3) Competitive comparison: SpaceX, Blue Origin, ULA, Rocket Lab (2020–2024)
- Launch frequency: Annual orbital launch counts per company; explicitly exclude suborbital (e.g., New Shepard) except where noted. Use BryceTech provider-level counts; confirm with company manifest summaries/press releases and FAA for U.S.-licensed missions [1][2][3][15][17][19].
- Cost per kg:
  - SpaceX: Website-published list prices and performance (to compute list $/kg to LEO/GTO using official payload tables); note changes over time and whether expendable/RTLS/ASDS [15][19].
  - ULA: Use official payload performance and any published pricing statements; supplement with NASA/USSF public contract values with caveats on scope [10][11][17].
  - Rocket Lab: Electron list price and performance; Neutron target pricing/performance from official materials (web, SEC filings, investor decks) [20].
  - Blue Origin: New Glenn performance table and any officially stated pricing (if none, note absence); rely on contract announcements (e.g., Amazon Kuiper) to indicate demand, not price [13][16].
- Mission success rates: Use BryceTech mission outcomes and company/agency post-flight statements. Define success/partial/failure criteria; note whether test flights (e.g., Falcon 9 early reuse milestones, Rocket Lab test flights, Starship IFTs) are included or broken out [3][15][19][20].
- Flagship launch systems and status/specs:
  - SpaceX: Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy (payload capacity, reusability features, Merlin/Raptor, booster reuse counts), Starship testing status — cite official pages/press kits and FAA/SpaceX updates [15][19].
  - Blue Origin: New Glenn status and key specs (two-stage, BE-4 engines, fairing diameter, advertised LEO/GTO capacity); New Shepard as out-of-scope except for context [16].
  - ULA: Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy retirement timing, Vulcan Centaur status; payload capacities and reusability (none for Atlas/Delta; SMART reuse concept may be noted as not fielded) [17].
  - Rocket Lab: Electron specs and recovery experiments; Neutron development status and target performance/reusability design [20].
- Partnerships and contracts: NASA (LSP/VADR/CLPS), DoD/USSF/NRO (NSSL), ESA/national agencies, and commercial operators (Amazon Kuiper, OneWeb, Telesat, Planet). Cite official award/contract announcements from agencies and companies [10][11][12][13][18].
- Geographic footprint: Principal sites (e.g., Cape Canaveral/KSC, Vandenberg, Wallops, Mahia, Kodiak, Guiana Space Centre, Satish Dhawan, Jiuquan/Xichang/Wenchang/Taiyuan as global context) and range capacity developments (new pads, cadence constraints). Cite spaceport operators/agency pages and FAA AST [1][2][14][16][18][21].

4) Reconciling conflicting sources
- Where SIA, Space Foundation, and Euroconsult report different revenue totals or definitions, present them side-by-side with URLs and a short methods note.
- Where provider launch counts differ across open datasets, prefer BryceTech’s annual summary for global coverage; cross-check with company/agency records and note any definitional differences (e.g., whether failed-to-orbit attempts are counted as “orbital attempts”).

## Deliverables

- A fully cited report with:
  - 2020–2024 annual market revenues (USD nominal), global commercial orbital launch counts, YoY growth, and CAGR (2020–2024).
  - Segmentation across customer type, payload purpose, orbit class, payload mass class, and geography (provider country and primary spaceport).
  - Drivers and barriers quantified where possible, with per-program figures for Starlink/OneWeb/Kuiper and defense demand (NSSL).
  - Competitive comparison across SpaceX, Blue Origin, ULA, Rocket Lab (launch counts, cost/kg, success rates, systems/specs, contracts, sites).
- A “Methods and Sources” appendix that maps each figure to its source(s) and explains estimation procedures and any adjustments.

## Clarifications Requested Before Data Collection

- Should inflation-adjusted revenue series be included alongside nominal? If so, specify base year and preferred inflation index (default: U.S. CPI-U, annual average).
- Are non-U.S. providers/operators to be included in total market sizing and segmentation (default: yes, for global market view)?
- Are paywalled figures acceptable if validated via official press releases/executive summaries? If not, the analysis will rely solely on publicly available figures.
- Tolerance for ranges vs single-point estimates when sources conflict (default: show both values with methodological notes).

## Work Plan and Timing

- Day 1–2: Extract 2020–2024 revenue figures (SIA/Space Foundation), global launch counts and segmentation (BryceTech/FAA AST/UCS), and compile customer/payload/orbit distributions.
- Day 3–4: Compile competitive company data: launch counts, mission outcomes, lists prices/performance, key contracts, and sites with agency/company citations.
- Day 5: Reconciliation of discrepancies, finalize growth metrics (YoY/CAGR), assemble charts/tables, and produce the fully cited report.

## Notes on Evidence Standards

- Every numeric value or factual claim in the final report will include a direct URL to a primary source or recognized industry dataset/executive release.
- Test flights and suborbital flights will be explicitly labeled and excluded from “orbital commercial launch” counts unless context requires noting them (e.g., reusability development).
