# Is a U.S. bachelor’s degree worth it today? An evidence-based assessment (2015–2025)

## Scope, definitions, and methods
- Focus: Undergraduate (bachelor’s) outcomes in the United States, 2015–2025. Graduate and associate/certificate outcomes appear only where essential for context and are labeled as such.
- Dollars and deflator: Unless noted, dollar figures are in 2024 USD using the CPI-U (U.S. city average) deflator. Example index values: 2015 = 237.017; 2024 annual average ≈ 314 (final BLS annual table). Convert nominal year t dollars by multiplying by (CPI-U 2024 avg / CPI-U year t avg) [36].
- Causality vs. correlation: Where evidence is causal (e.g., admissions RDD, waitlist variation, matched-choice sets), it is identified as such. Aggregate pay gaps (e.g., BLS) are descriptive and reflect both returns and selection.

## Bottom line in one paragraph
For most students who enroll at public or private nonprofit four-year colleges, a bachelor’s degree still pays off financially—median graduates earn substantially more, face lower unemployment, and typically recoup net tuition within 5–10 years, with additional non-monetary benefits (health, civic engagement) and mobility gains. However, outcomes vary widely by completion, field of study, institution type, and demographics. Risks concentrate among noncompleters, graduates in low-earning fields or weak programs (especially at for-profits), and borrowers facing repayment challenges. Recent policies (e.g., SAVE income-driven repayment) meaningfully reduce downside risk, though litigation and operational volatility complicate near-term repayment. Alternatives (apprenticeships, selected sub-BA pathways) can deliver strong returns at lower cost in specific fields, and employer “degree reset” dynamics may reduce degree requirements for some jobs without fully replacing the screening role of a BA.

## Pro and con arguments (exactly four each)

| Pro/Con | Thesis | Supporting Evidence | Reasoning/Analysis | Populations/Context | Limitations/Uncertainty | Source Name | Publication Date | Source URL(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro | Most bachelor’s degrees deliver strong earnings and employment premiums and recoup net costs within a decade—especially at public and private nonprofit institutions. | - 2024 median weekly earnings: BA $1,543 vs HS $930; unemployment 2.5% vs 4.2% (25+ full-time) [1]. - “Price-to-Earnings Premium” (PEP): 94% of public and 80% of private nonprofit four-year colleges enable students to recoup net tuition within 10 years; 57% within 5 years; 45% of for-profits take 26+ years or never [2]. - Long-horizon ROI: CEW’s 2025 update finds bachelor’s institutions generally offer strong 40-year ROI; shorter horizons vary by price/earnings [3]. - Prime-age employment premium: college EPOP ≈ 11.9 percentage points higher than noncollege; differences driven more by participation than unemployment [4]. - Net tuition/fees (public in-state) after grants fell to ≈$2,480 in 2024–25 (real) [35]. | Earnings and employment advantages compound over time; even modest annual premia, applied to multi-decade careers, dwarf typical net tuition/fee costs—particularly in-state publics with low net price. Shorter PEP for publics reflects lower net price; longer PEP for for-profits signals risk. Employment-rate premia further boost lifetime income beyond wage gaps. | U.S. 2015–2025; full-time workers 25+; sector variation (public/nonprofit vs for-profit); national averages; net price data reflect first-time, full-time students. | BLS gaps are descriptive (selection bias). CEW/Third Way depend on Scorecard medians for aid recipients and state HS earnings benchmarks; room/board and opportunity costs vary. PEP doesn’t include foregone earnings; CEW ROI does. | BLS Education Pays; Third Way PEP; Georgetown CEW ROI 2025; NY Fed Liberty Street Economics; College Board Trends | 2024; 2023; 2025; 2025; 2024 | [1], [2], [3], [4], [35] |
| Pro | New income-driven repayment (SAVE) materially reduces repayment burden and downside risk for many bachelor’s borrowers, accelerating financial stability. | - SAVE sets payments at 5% of discretionary income (UG loans), protects 225% of FPL, and prevents interest growth when payments are made; early forgiveness for low original balances [6], [7]. - Example: Single BA earner ≈$55k/yr (from 2024 Q1 wages) would pay ≈$92/mo under SAVE; at $40k, ≈$30/mo [8]. - FSA: Wide SAVE enrollment; policy aims to expand $0 payments for low incomes and stop negative amortization [6], [9]. | By aligning payments with earnings, SAVE curbs delinquency/default and allows graduates to invest in job search, relocation, or further skill-building. Early forgiveness for small balances shortens tail risk, especially for completers from lower-cost public programs. | U.S. federal Direct Loan borrowers with UG debt (Parent PLUS excluded). Effects largest for low-to-moderate earners and early-career graduates. | 2025 litigation placed many SAVE borrowers into administrative forbearance; timelines and credit counting are fluid. SAVE’s fiscal cost is debated; employer-benefit interactions vary [9], [37]. | StudentAid.gov (SAVE); White House SAVE fact sheet; BLS earnings; FSA Data Center; PWBM (context on costs) | 2023–2025 | [6], [7], [8], [9], [37] |
| Pro | Non-monetary and mobility benefits are sizable: BA attainment correlates with longer life and civic outcomes; selective admissions can causally boost elite leadership access; some colleges add substantial value for lower-income students. | - Mortality gap: BA vs non-BA life expectancy gap >8 years (1992–2021) [10]; U.S. college grads live ≈11 years longer than those without HS diplomas (2019) [11]. - Ivy-Plus admission causes large gains in elite outcomes (top 1% earnings +60%, elite firms tripled), with modest average earnings effects—consistent with network/placement value [12]. - Institutional value-added varies; resources, completion, and STEM completion predict higher earnings value-added; selectivity is a weak predictor within choice sets [13]. - Mobility Report Cards identify colleges propelling low-income students upward; expanding access could reduce gaps [38]. | Health and civic benefits (correlational) reinforce financial ROI. Causal admission effects show colleges can open elite pathways beyond human-capital gains. Institutional “value-added” evidence guides students toward high-ROI campuses serving similar applicants well. | U.S. adults (health data); U.S. selective-admission students (Ivy-Plus); Texas publics for value-added; low-income/first-gen mobility context. | Health links are largely correlational (selection, behaviors, job quality). Ivy-Plus findings target elite outcomes; not generalizable to average earnings. Value-added results are state/context specific. | NBER (Case & Deaton); IHME; NBER (Chetty et al.); NBER (Mountjoy & Hickman); Opportunity Insights | 2023–2025; 2025; 2023; 2021; 2017–2020s | [10], [11], [12], [13], [38] |
| Pro | Causal evidence shows large returns at the margin to four-year admission and strong payoffs to major choice; a BA is the primary gateway to high-paying fields with low underemployment. | - Admissions RDD: Attending a flagship/state university raises long-run earnings ≈20–22% for marginal admits [15], [16] (causal). - Major choice: Large, causal payoffs by field (e.g., engineering/CS/health > arts/education); program-level earnings vary widely across colleges for the same major [39]. - Underemployment by major: STEM/health/business show lower underemployment and higher wages for recent BA grads [5]. | Even for students near the admissions margin, four-year access can meaningfully raise earnings. Major choice explains large earnings differences; BA pathways are often necessary for fields with the best pay and stability. | U.S. flagships (Hoekstra; Zimmerman—Florida); U.S. majors (FRBNY); program-level Scorecard data (CEW). | Some evidence (e.g., Norway IV papers) not used here to keep U.S. focus. RDD effects are local to cutoffs; program earnings medians mask within-field dispersion. | Review of Economics & Statistics; Journal of Labor Economics; FRBNY major tool; Georgetown CEW Buyer Beware | 2009; 2014; updated through 2025; 2022 | [15], [16], [5], [39] |
| Con | Completion risk and time-to-degree are substantial; noncompletion and weaker sectors (especially for-profit/online) drive poor outcomes and long or negative ROI. | - Six-year completion (fall 2018 starters): 61.1% overall; public 4-year ≈70.7%, private nonprofit ≈75.5%, private for-profit ≈35.9% [14]. - Time-to-degree: Many take >4 years; delayed completion raises costs and foregone earnings [15]. - Online harms: Taking courses online reduces grades and persistence; effects larger for lower-GPA students (quasi-experimental/experimental) [16]. - For-profit online bachelor’s: ≈12 pp lower completion vs other online providers [17]; for-profit attendance linked to weaker earnings and higher debt [18], with certificate evidence (context) also weak [19]. | Completion is the single biggest driver of ROI; delayed or no degree stretches payback and raises the risk of non-repayment. Sector and modality matter: outcomes are weakest at for-profits and in fully online settings without strong supports. | U.S. first-time degree-seeking cohorts; modality differences; sector (public/nonprofit/for-profit). | NSC captures completions anywhere; doesn’t isolate BA-only starts perfectly in all cuts. Online evidence varies by institution type; some nonprofit online models may differ. For-profit results stronger in certificates but extend to many BA settings. | NSC Yearly Progress; NSC Time to Degree; AER (Online classes); Forbes (online for-profit completion); Journal of Human Resources; Brookings (Gainful Employment, sub-BA) | 2024; 2014; 2017; 2023; 2019; 2017 | [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] |
| Con | Early-career underemployment is common and persistent; a BA does not guarantee a college-level job, with strong variation by major and region. | - Recent BA underemployment ≈40–41%; unemployment ≈5–6% (2024–2025) [5]. - Only about half of BA grads obtain a college-level job within a year; starting underemployed makes grads ≈5× more likely to remain underemployed at 5 years; 74% underemployed at 5 years remain so at 10 years [20], [21]. - Mismatch penalties: Working outside one’s field reduces earnings, especially in occupation-specific majors [22]. - Real pay varies by region: local prices (RPP) change purchasing power and practical ROI [23]. | Underemployment erodes early earnings and can “stick,” delaying wealth-building and payback. Field choice and local labor markets matter; students in lower-demand fields and high-cost regions face longer break-even timelines. | U.S. recent grads (22–27); occupation-based underemployment; major-specific outcomes; state/metro price differences. | Underemployment definitions vary across datasets. Burning Glass/Strada rely on resumes/postings; some measures are correlational. RPP adjusts prices, not job quality differences. | FRBNY Recent Grads; Strada/Burning Glass reports; Robst (EER); BEA RPP | 2024–2025; 2018 & 2024; 2007; 2024 | [5], [20], [21], [22], [23] |
| Con | Debt burdens and repayment struggles remain for many; delinquencies rose post-pause; racial and income disparities are large; Parent PLUS exposure is significant. | - Student loan delinquency (90+ dpd) rose to 7.7% in Q1 2025 and 10.2% by Q2 2025 as reporting resumed [24]. - Federal portfolio: 42.3M recipients; $1.67T; >10M with a loan in forbearance, including ~7M in SAVE-related forbearance during litigation [9]. - Racial default divides: ≈50% of Black borrowers ever default; ≈40% of Hispanic borrowers vs ≈29% of White borrowers; multiple defaults more common among Black/Hispanic borrowers [25]. - Parent PLUS outstanding roughly doubled 2014–2024 (≈$62B→$110B), adding risk for BA families [26]. - SHED (2025): ~20% of borrowers were behind on payments in 2024 (all degrees) [27]. | Restart frictions and economic conditions expose repayment fragility, especially for noncompleters and disadvantaged borrowers. PLUS debt shifts risk to parents; racial inequities in default reflect compounding disparities in earnings/wealth. | U.S. federal borrowers across education levels (not BA-only for some measures); BA families with PLUS; distribution by race/ethnicity. | Pause/on‑ramp/forbearance distort 2020–2025 time series; some measures cover all degree types (not BA-only) and are noted as such. | FRBNY HDC; FSA Data Center; Pew; IES PLUS; Federal Reserve SHED | 2025; 2025; 2024; 2024; 2025 | [24], [9], [25], [26], [27] |
| Con | ROI is highly heterogeneous; many programs—especially at for-profits and in low-earning fields—have weak/negative payback; degree requirements are easing in some roles, and alternatives can rival BA returns in targeted fields. | - At ≈30% of institutions, most students do not earn more than HS grads 10 years after enrollment (institution-level screen) [28]. - PEP: 45% of for-profits take 26+ years or never to recoup [2]. - Accountability rules (FVT/GE) target programs with high debt-to-earnings or no earnings premium (thresholds published by ED) [29]. - Degree reset: BA requirements in postings fell (2019–2024); BA+ postings down from 20.4%→17.8%; 52% of postings had no formal education requirement by early 2024 [30]. Yet “skills-based” hiring reforms changed <1 in 700 actual hires in 2023 (few firms sustain practice changes), indicating limited realized erosion of BA screening to date [31], [32]. - Alternatives: Registered Apprenticeship participation ~doubled since 2015; evaluations show 40–50% earnings gains within 2–3 years and positive cost-benefit [33], [34] (non-BA). | Negative/low ROI clusters are real (especially for-profits). Some occupations no longer require a BA formally, but realized hiring remains degree-centric absent deeper reforms. In trades/tech fields, apprenticeships and some sub-BA pathways can beat BA on short-horizon ROI and debt avoidance. | U.S. institution/program heterogeneity; job postings and hires (private sector); registered apprentices in selected sectors (non-BA). | CEW/PEP metrics rely on Scorecard medians; postings ≠ hires; degree reset varies by firm/occupation; apprenticeship completion rates vary by sponsor/sector. | GE/Third Way/CEW; Indeed Hiring Lab; BGI/HKS; CRS Apprenticeship; Urban Institute | 2022–2025; 2024; 2024; 2025; 2016–2024 | [28], [2], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] |

## What matters most for prospective students
- Completion probability and time-to-degree: The single biggest ROI lever is finishing on time. Choose institutions with strong completion value-added and supports for your profile [13], [14], [15].
- Field of study: Major choice strongly shapes earnings/underemployment. STEM/health/business fields have lower underemployment today; arts/education require careful financial planning or subsidized pathways [5], [39].
- Institution type and price: Public in-state and many private nonprofits with strong aid deliver shorter payback; approach for-profits with caution given consistently weaker outcomes on average [2], [18], [19], [35].
- Net price vs sticker: Focus on your net price. Average in-state public net tuition/fees ≈$2,480 (2024–25), but room/board and foregone earnings dominate total cost; model your local COA and opportunity cost in 2024 USD [35], [36].
- Repayment plan: Enroll in IDR (SAVE) if income is low/moderate to cap payments and prevent balance growth; monitor litigation updates and servicer communications [6], [7], [9].
- Geography: Adjust expected earnings with local price levels (RPP) and job mix; ROI differs across states/metros [23].
- Alternatives: If you’re targeting skilled trades or specific IT roles, compare high-quality registered apprenticeships or sub-BA programs with audited outcomes; ensure placement and wage data are credible [33], [34].
