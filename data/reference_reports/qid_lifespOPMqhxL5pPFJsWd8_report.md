# High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) in Ski Mountaineers ≥3,000 m: Mechanisms, Case Documentation Standards, Acute and Long-Term Management, and Prevention

## Scope and population
This synthesis focuses on ski mountaineers, backcountry skiers, and ski alpinists operating at altitudes ≥3,000 m who develop HAPE. The recommendations and evidence also draw from broader high-altitude cohorts (trekkers, climbers, military) where sport-specific studies are limited, with adaptations for cold, remote, high-exertion environments typical of ski mountaineering. Guidance and dosing follow consensus and clinical trial data where available [Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) 2019 guidelines][1].

## Pathophysiology: Predominant mechanisms and key modifiers
- Core mechanism: hypoxia-driven, heterogeneous hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) causing uneven regional perfusion and very high pulmonary artery and capillary pressures that produce hydrostatic, noncardiogenic edema (“capillary stress failure”). Right ventricular afterload and pulmonary arterial systolic pressure are markedly elevated during HAPE episodes, with hemodynamic evidence showing increased pulmonary capillary pressure early in the course [Circulation hemodynamic study][5]; [reviews][7][8].
- Edema characteristics: edema fluid is protein-rich with evidence of microhemorrhage on bronchoalveolar lavage, consistent with high-permeability injury secondary to mechanical stress rather than primary infection/inflammation; inflammatory markers often rise later as a secondary phenomenon [BAL study][9]; [reviews][7][8].
- Endothelial/vasoactive factors: decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased endothelin-1 in susceptible individuals promote exaggerated HPV and high pressures [NO/endothelin data][11]; [reviews][7][8].
- Alveolar fluid clearance: impaired epithelial sodium-channel (ENaC) and Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated fluid clearance contributes to edema accumulation; beta-agonists (e.g., salmeterol) can augment clearance and reduce HAPE risk in susceptible subjects [J Appl Physiol physiologic study][10]; [NEJM RCT][2]; [reviews][7][8].
- Cofactors and triggers: rapid ascent, high exertion, cold exposure (augmenting sympathetic tone and HPV), and intercurrent respiratory infection increase risk and severity. Ski mountaineering adds high-intensity exertion with hyperventilation of cold, dry air, frequent rapid altitude gains, and logistical constraints on descent, oxygen, and shelter [reviews][7][8]; [WMS guideline][1].

## How comparable cases are documented in the literature
HAPE is described across case reports/series, observational cohorts, volunteer chamber/field studies, and clinical trials, along with society guidelines and consensus statements. Standardized reporting improves comparability:

- Individual-case data elements to capture:
  - Sport/discipline; region/mountain range; altitude band (3,000–3,999 m; 4,000–4,999 m; ≥5,000 m)
  - Ascent profile (rate, days above 2,500 m; sleeping vs maximum altitude)
  - Environmental conditions (temperature, wind, storm), exertion intensity
  - Time-to-onset (hours/days since arrival to current sleeping altitude)
  - Symptoms/signs (disproportionate exertional dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, orthopnea, cough, pink frothy sputum, tachypnea/tachycardia, crackles, cyanosis)
  - Pulse oximetry (rest and exertional)
  - Imaging (portable CXR/ultrasound/CT if available); echocardiography (RV strain, PASP estimates)
  - Labs where available (CBC, CRP, BNP/NT-proBNP), BAL if research setting
  - Comorbidities (especially prior HAPE)
  - Management (descent, oxygen, hyperbaric bag parameters/duration, pharmacotherapy with dose/regimen)
  - Outcomes (time to clinical improvement; oxygen requirement; need for evacuation/hospitalization; radiographic resolution time; mortality); recurrence on return to altitude
These fields align with clinical and research variables used across the HAPE literature and guidelines [WMS guideline][1]; [pathophysiology and clinical reviews][7][8].

## Acute management: Field and hospital

Principles: Immediate reduction of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension and restoration of oxygenation. Urgent descent and oxygen are most effective and should not be delayed while arranging adjuncts [WMS guideline][1].

- Immediate actions (field)
  - Stop ascent; minimal exertion, keep warm, hydrate judiciously.
  - Urgent descent: aim for ≥300–1,000 m loss in sleeping altitude as soon as safely feasible; even partial descent typically improves symptoms and oxygenation within hours [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].
  - Supplemental oxygen: target SpO2 ≥90–92% at rest; start 2–4 L/min by nasal cannula and titrate (often 4–6 L/min or nonrebreather at 10–15 L/min are needed). Expect noticeable clinical improvement over hours with adequate oxygenation [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].
  - Portable hyperbaric chamber (Gamow/Certec/others): use when descent/oxygen are not immediately available, or as a bridge. Pressurize typically 2–4 psi above ambient (≈1,500–2,000 m equivalent descent), treat in 60–120 minute sessions, decompress periodically, and repeat as needed. Risks: overheating, CO2 buildup; requires close monitoring and trained attendant [systematic review][14]; [WMS guideline][1].

- Pharmacologic therapy (adjuncts; do not delay descent/oxygen)
  - Nifedipine (pulmonary vasodilator): preferred drug for known HAPE-susceptible or moderate disease when oxygen/descent are delayed/unavailable. Suggested treatment dosing: sustained-release 30 mg every 12 h (or 20 mg every 8 h). Monitor for hypotension, dizziness; avoid combining with other potent vasodilators without monitoring [WMS guideline dosing][1]; [NEJM prevention trial][4].
  - Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil): reduce pulmonary pressures; evidence strongest for prevention in susceptible individuals, but commonly used as treatment adjuncts when oxygen/descent delayed. Suggested regimens: sildenafil 50 mg every 8 h or tadalafil 10 mg every 12 h. Avoid with nitrates; caution with hypotension [WMS guideline][1]; [Ann Intern Med RCT][3].
  - Inhaled beta-agonists (e.g., salmeterol): shown to reduce HAPE incidence in susceptible subjects (likely via enhanced alveolar fluid clearance). Role in treatment is adjunctive and less certain; consider where available. Prophylaxis regimen studied: salmeterol 125 µg inhaled twice daily in susceptible subjects [NEJM RCT][2]; [WMS guideline][1].
  - Agents not recommended for HAPE treatment:
    - Acetazolamide is helpful for AMS prevention/acclimatization, not for HAPE treatment; do not use as primary HAPE therapy [WMS guideline][1].
    - Diuretics are generally contraindicated unless there is clear fluid overload or heart failure; HAPE patients are often intravascularly depleted [WMS guideline][1].
    - Dexamethasone: proven for HACE/AMS; not a first-line HAPE treatment. It has prophylactic efficacy in HAPE-susceptible subjects in an RCT but is not the preferred routine prophylaxis for HAPE; consider only in very high-risk, under expert guidance [Ann Intern Med RCT][3]; [WMS guideline][1].

- Hospital care
  - Supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥92–94%; consider high-flow nasal cannula if needed. Most patients improve rapidly with oxygen and rest; radiographic resolution typically occurs over 24–72 hours after descent/oxygen [reviews][7][8].
  - Positive-pressure support: CPAP/PEEP can improve oxygenation in severe cases; intubation/mechanical ventilation is rare and reserved for refractory respiratory failure or concomitant conditions [WMS guideline][1].
  - Inhaled nitric oxide can acutely reduce pulmonary pressures but is logistically complex and used in specialized settings; not a field therapy [reviews][7][8].
  - Differential diagnosis: rule out pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic edema; clinical context, imaging, labs (including BNP) and, if available, echocardiography guide evaluation [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].

- Expected time course and outcomes
  - With oxygen, rest, and descent, dyspnea and hypoxemia usually improve within hours; crackles and radiographs improve over 1–3 days. Delayed recognition and continued ascent markedly increase risk of respiratory failure and death [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].

## Pharmacologic details: Dosing, indications, contraindications, and safety
- Nifedipine (SR): 30 mg orally every 12 h (or 20 mg every 8 h) for treatment; for prevention in known HAPE-susceptible who must ascend, similar dosing has supportive evidence. Monitor BP; adverse effects include hypotension, flushing, headache; caution with concomitant vasodilators and in cold exposure where hypotension risk is greater [WMS guideline][1]; [NEJM][4].
- Sildenafil: 50 mg orally every 8 h (prevention/treatment adjunct); tadalafil 10 mg every 12 h (prevention; used as treatment adjunct). Adverse effects: headache, flushing, visual changes, hypotension; strong contraindication with nitrates [WMS guideline][1]; [Ann Intern Med][3].
- Salmeterol: prophylaxis in HAPE-susceptible (inhaled 125 µg twice daily in RCT). Adverse effects: tremor, tachycardia. Treatment role is uncertain; if used, it should be adjunctive to oxygen/descent [NEJM][2]; [WMS guideline][1].
- Dexamethasone: prophylaxis option in very high-risk HAPE-susceptible when other measures are not feasible (8 mg loading, then 4 mg every 6 h in RCT); not first-line for HAPE prevention nor treatment [Ann Intern Med][3]; [WMS guideline][1].
- Agents to avoid as primary therapy in HAPE: diuretics (unless fluid overload), acetazolamide (not a HAPE treatment), morphine (respiratory depression), and routine antibiotics unless bacterial infection suspected [WMS guideline][1].

## Oxygen therapy: Practical targets and logistics for ski mountaineers
- Target SpO2 ≥90–92% at rest; titrate flow to symptoms and oximetry. Nasal cannula (2–6 L/min) may be inadequate; use nonrebreather mask at 10–15 L/min if needed. Maintain warmth to reduce oxygen consumption and HPV. Plan for cylinder capacity and flow-rate budgeting in cold conditions; protect regulators from freezing [WMS guideline][1].

## Portable hyperbaric protocols (Gamow/Certec)
- Indications: when descent is unsafe/unavailable or to temporize pending evacuation.
- Settings: pressurize to 2–4 psi above ambient; 60–120 minute sessions; continuous supervision; periodic venting to control CO2/heat; repeat sessions until sustained improvement or evacuation. Hyperbaric therapy can produce rapid symptomatic improvements akin to a 1,500–2,000 m descent equivalent [systematic review][14]; [WMS guideline][1].

## Imaging, echocardiography, and biomarkers
- CXR: patchy, often peripheral alveolar opacities; may be unilateral or bilateral; cardiomegaly typically absent (noncardiogenic). Lung ultrasound (if available) shows confluent B-lines in affected regions; practical in field teams with handheld devices.
- Echo: elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and signs of right heart strain; helps exclude cardiogenic etiologies. Hemodynamic evidence implicates increased pulmonary capillary pressure early in HAPE [hemodynamic study][5]; [reviews][7][8].
- BAL/biomarkers (research settings): protein-rich fluid and microhemorrhage support capillary stress failure; inflammatory signals often rise later [BAL][9]; [reviews][7][8].

## Outcomes, recurrence risk, and long-term sequelae
- With prompt descent and oxygen, mortality is low; delays can be fatal. Radiographic and symptomatic resolution typically occurs within days after descent/oxygen. Transient reductions in diffusion capacity may persist for days to weeks but long-term pulmonary sequelae are uncommon in otherwise healthy individuals [reviews][7][8].
- Recurrence: prior HAPE strongly predicts recurrence on re-exposure, reflecting an individual susceptibility; recurrence risk is high without preventive measures (reports in susceptible cohorts), necessitating aggressive prevention planning [reviews][7][8]; [WMS guideline][1].

## Prevention and acclimatization strategies for ski mountaineers

- Nonpharmacologic (first-line for all)
  - Ascent rules: above 3,000 m, limit sleeping altitude gains to ≤300–500 m per day with a rest day every 3–4 days or after each 1,000 m gain; avoid rapid ascents when possible [WMS guideline][1].
  - Staged ascent and pre-acclimatization (IHE/IHT): staged sleeping at intermediate huts; intermittent hypoxic exposure may help when executed properly, though protocols vary across programs and evidence is heterogeneous [WMS guideline][1].
  - Load management: temper exertion on arrival days and first nights at new sleeping altitudes; avoid all-out efforts in cold, stormy conditions until acclimatized [reviews][7][8].
  - Infection control: defer ascent/trips during acute respiratory infections [WMS guideline][1].
  - Monitoring: routine buddy-checks; pulse oximetry at rest and with exertion to detect outliers relative to team; early symptoms prompt rest/descent [WMS guideline][1].

- Pharmacologic prophylaxis (for HAPE-susceptible or unavoidable rapid ascent; use with an ascent plan, not in lieu of it)
  - Nifedipine SR 30 mg every 12 h (or 20 mg every 8 h) starting before ascent and continued while above critical altitudes; strongest historical evidence and guideline endorsement for HAPE-susceptible individuals [NEJM][4]; [WMS guideline][1].
  - Tadalafil 10 mg every 12 h or sildenafil 50 mg every 8 h as alternatives; effective in susceptible subjects for prevention; consider side-effect profile and logistics [Ann Intern Med][3]; [WMS guideline][1].
  - Salmeterol 125 µg inhaled twice daily reduced HAPE incidence in susceptible subjects; consider as adjunctive prophylaxis if vasodilators are contraindicated [NEJM][2]; [WMS guideline][1].
  - Dexamethasone (e.g., 8 mg loading then 4 mg every 6 h) is effective in RCT prevention among susceptible subjects but is not preferred routine prophylaxis for HAPE; reserve for select very high-risk scenarios under expert guidance [Ann Intern Med][3]; [WMS guideline][1].
  - Avoid combining multiple vasodilators without monitoring; manage hypotension risk carefully in cold environments.

- Equipment and team protocols for ski mountaineering
  - Carry: high-flow oxygen delivery (nonrebreather mask), adequate O2 supply for 6–12 hours at 10–15 L/min if feasible; portable hyperbaric bag and CO2 scrubber where rescue/descent is uncertain; pulse oximeter(s) with warm-up strategies in cold; warming gear; pharmacologic kit (nifedipine SR; sildenafil/tadalafil; salmeterol; dexamethasone for HACE backup); communication and evacuation plan [WMS guideline][1]; [UIAA/ISMM advice][12].

## Practical field algorithm (ski mountaineers)
1) Suspect HAPE in any skier at altitude with new disproportionate dyspnea, cough, reduced exercise tolerance, orthopnea, or rales; check SpO2 against peers. 2) Stop ascent, minimize exertion, insulate. 3) Start oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥90–92%. 4) Arrange immediate descent ≥300–1,000 m; if impossible, use portable hyperbaric bag. 5) Consider nifedipine SR (30 mg q12h) if oxygen/descent delayed, especially in known HAPE-susceptible; consider sildenafil 50 mg q8h or tadalafil 10 mg q12h if nifedipine contraindicated; salmeterol as adjunct. 6) Evacuate to definitive care; avoid diuretics/acetazolamide as primary HAPE therapy. 7) Resume ascent only after full resolution; institute prevention plan [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].

## Return to altitude and recurrence mitigation
- Do not reascend until fully recovered (asymptomatic at rest and with light exertion, near-normal SpO2 at the same altitude off oxygen, and clinical/radiographic resolution if obtained). For those with prior HAPE or marked susceptibility, future trips should include staged ascent, close monitoring, and, when indicated, prophylaxis (nifedipine SR or PDE‑5 inhibitor) with shared decision-making and clear rescue plans [WMS guideline][1]; [reviews][7][8].

## Research quality, gaps, and 2020–2025 emphasis
- Randomized trials exist for prevention in susceptible individuals (nifedipine, tadalafil, dexamethasone, salmeterol), but there are no large RCTs of field treatment comparing oxygen/descent vs drug adjuncts in ski-mountaineer populations. Most treatment recommendations are extrapolated from physiology, prevention trials, case series, and expert consensus [NEJM][2][4]; [Ann Intern Med][3]; [WMS guideline][1].
- 2020–2025 guidance has not markedly altered core acute management principles (descent and oxygen first; hyperbaric as bridge; cautious use of vasodilators), though device/evacuation logistics and monitoring tech (portable ultrasound, better oximeters) continue to evolve. Contemporary consensus statements from mountaineering organizations reinforce these principles for field realities [WMS guideline][1]; [UIAA/ISMM advice][12].

## Standardized data extraction template for the planned systematic review
- Identification: sport/discipline; geography; season; expedition vs day tour; team size and support.
- Exposure: absolute altitudes (sleeping/max), altitude bands, ascent rates, duration at altitude, prior acclimatization/hypoxic training.
- Environment and exertion: temperature, wind, storm events, time-on-feet/vertical gain, pack weight, hydration/nutrition, infection symptoms.
- Clinical: time-to-onset; symptoms/signs; SpO2 (rest/exertional); vitals; imaging; echocardiography; labs; BAL (if research).
- Management: descent magnitude/timing; oxygen delivery (device, flow, hours, SpO2 targets); hyperbaric (device, pressure, duration, cycles); pharmacotherapy (agent, dose, route, timing); complications/adverse effects.
- Outcomes: time to symptom improvement; SpO2 change; need for evacuation/hospitalization; length of stay; mortality; imaging resolution time; return-to-activity; recurrence on re-exposure; long-term pulmonary testing (DLCO/spirometry).
- Study quality: design, case definition, comparators, outcome ascertainment, risk of bias.

## Key takeaways for teams
- Prevention is paramount: staged ascent and conservative effort during early exposure days are the most powerful interventions.
- If HAPE is suspected: stop ascent, give oxygen, and descend without delay. Portable hyperbaric chambers and vasodilators are bridges/adjuncts—not replacements—for descent and oxygen.
- Prior HAPE demands a tailored prevention plan (often including nifedipine SR or a PDE‑5 inhibitor) plus stricter ascent controls and robust evacuation contingencies.
