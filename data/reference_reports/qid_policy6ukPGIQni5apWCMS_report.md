# Multi‑State Biometric Compliance: Current, Enforceable Requirements and Risk Landscape (Illinois BIPA, Texas CUBI, Washington RCW 19.375)

## Scope and currency (as of September 16, 2025)

- Illinois BIPA (740 ILCS 14) is in force statewide. The only post‑2020 amendment is Public Act 103‑0769 (SB 2979), effective August 2, 2024; it (a) clarifies that a “written release” includes an electronic signature and (b) limits damages for 15(b) and 15(d) to a single recovery per person where the same method is used (and, for 15(d), to the same recipient). No stays or injunctions apply. Courts are split on retroactive application; the codified, enforceable text is prospective and operative now. [1][2][4][6]  
- Texas CUBI (Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 503.001) is in force statewide. The 89th Legislature’s H.B. 149 (2025) amends § 503.001 effective January 1, 2026 (AI‑related clarifications, additional exemptions, and notice/consent clarification); until then, the current statute applies. No stays or sunsets are noted. [24][25]  
- Washington RCW 19.375 (Biometric identifiers) has not been amended since enactment in 2017 and remains in force. It is enforced solely by the Attorney General under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA, RCW 19.86). No stays or sunsets are noted. [37][40][42]  

## At‑a‑Glance: What each law does

### Illinois BIPA (740 ILCS 14)
- Purpose/scope: Regulates private entities’ collection, use, disclosure, retention, and destruction of “biometric identifiers” and “biometric information.” Applies broadly to consumer‑facing and employment uses. [1][2]  
- Covered data: Biometric identifiers (retina/iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand/face geometry) and “biometric information” derived from them; notable exclusions include photographs, written signatures, and HIPAA treatment/payment/operations data. [2]  
- Core duties: Publicly available retention/destruction policy; pre‑collection written notice and written release; sale/profit ban; disclosure limits; reasonable security. [1][2][3]  
- Enforcement: Private right of action with liquidated damages; 2024 amendment limits recovery to one violation per person for 15(b)/15(d) where specified; 5‑year statute of limitations; class actions common. [4][6][9][10]  
- Key recent developments: P.A. 103‑0769 effective Aug. 2, 2024 (electronic signature; single‑recovery rule). Illinois Supreme Court holdings on accrual (Cothron), limitations (Tims), standing (“aggrieved” in Rosenbach), workers’ comp (McDonald), LMRA preemption (Walton), and HIPAA operations carve‑out (Mosby). Retroactivity of the 2024 damages change is unsettled in federal courts. [6][8][9][10][11][12]

### Texas CUBI (§ 503.001)
- Purpose/scope: Regulates any “person” capturing a biometric identifier “for a commercial purpose”; no private right of action—AG only. Applies to consumer and employee contexts; statute presumes employer security purpose ends at termination (retention trigger). [24]  
- Covered data: Biometric identifier means retina/iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or record of hand/face geometry. [24]  
- Core duties: Before capture, provide notice and obtain consent; destroy within a reasonable time, and no later than one year after the purpose expires; do not sell/disclose except under narrow exceptions; reasonable security. [24]  
- Enforcement: AG civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation; state enforcement is generally not constrained by the residual 4‑year limitations period. [24][26][36]  
- Key recent developments: H.B. 149 (effective Jan. 1, 2026) adds AI‑related exemptions and clarifies that “publicly available” media alone is not consent unless posted by the individual; training data later used for non‑exempt commercial purposes re‑enters CUBI. Large AG settlements with Meta ($1.4B; final judgment entered) and Google ($1.375B in principle). [25][27][28][29][30][31][32]

### Washington RCW 19.375 (Biometric identifiers)
- Purpose/scope: Limits enrollment, disclosure, and retention of biometric identifiers for a “commercial purpose” (defined), with a security carve‑out; AG‑only enforcement via the CPA (RCW 19.86). [37][38][39][40]  
- Covered data: Biometric identifier means data generated by automatic measurements (e.g., fingerprint, voiceprint, retina/iris) used to identify a specific individual; excludes photos, audio/video, and HIPAA treatment/payment/operations data. [38]  
- Core duties: Before enrollment for a commercial purpose, provide notice, obtain consent, or provide a mechanism to prevent subsequent use (opt‑out); do not disclose/sell for a commercial purpose without consent unless an exception applies, with contractual restrictions on vendors; retain no longer than reasonably necessary; reasonable security; obtain new consent for material changes. [39]  
- Enforcement: AG enforces under CPA; civil penalties under RCW 19.86.140 (up to $7,500 per UDAP violation; higher for injunction violations). No private right under RCW 19.375. [40][44]  
- Key recent developments: No amendments since enactment in 2017 (2017 c 299). Public AG enforcement explicitly citing RCW 19.375 is rare. [37][42]

## Side‑by‑side comparison

| Topic | Illinois BIPA (740 ILCS 14) | Texas CUBI (Bus. & Com. Code § 503.001) | Washington RCW 19.375 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Definitions; scope of data | “Biometric identifier” includes retina/iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand/face geometry; “biometric information” is info based on an identifier used to identify an individual. Excludes photographs, written signatures, and HIPAA TPO data. Applies to “private entities” (not government/courts). [2] | “Biometric identifier” includes retina/iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or record of hand/face geometry. Applies to any “person” capturing for a “commercial purpose.” [24] | “Biometric identifier” is data generated by automatic measurements (e.g., fingerprint, voiceprint, retina/iris) used to identify a specific individual; excludes photographs, audio/video and derived data, HIPAA TPO data. “Enroll” means capture→template→store for matching. [38] |
| Applicability: consumers vs. employees | Applies to both consumers and employees of private entities. [2] | Applies to consumers and employees; “purpose” for employer security presumed to expire at termination (retention trigger). [24] | Not status‑based; triggers when “enrolling” for a “commercial purpose,” which is defined (sale/disclosure to third parties for marketing unrelated to the initial transaction). Security uses are carved out. [39] |
| Geographic reach | No express extraterritorial clause; Illinois presumes no extraterritorial application absent clear intent; focus is on conduct in Illinois. [1][23] | No residency limit; Texas enforces where captures affect Texans. [24][29] | Enforced via CPA; “trade or commerce” covers conduct affecting Washingtonians. [40][43] |
| Consent | Before collection, inform in writing that biometrics are collected/stored; inform specific purpose/retention term; obtain a “written release” (includes electronic signature as of Aug. 2, 2024). [3][6] | Before capture, inform the individual and obtain consent; no specified form (not necessarily written). [24] | Before enrollment for a commercial purpose: provide notice, obtain consent, or provide a mechanism to prevent subsequent use (opt‑out). No consent/notice required for “security purpose.” [39] |
| Notice | Written notice of collection/storage, specific purpose, and retention term, before collection. [3] | Inform before capture (no specified content beyond informing). [24] | Provide notice sufficient to inform enrollment for a commercial purpose; material‑change rule requires fresh consent. [39] |
| Retention/destruction | Publicly available policy with retention schedule; destroy when purpose satisfied or within 3 years of last interaction, whichever comes first; comply with policy absent warrant/subpoena. [1][3] | Destroy within a reasonable time, no later than one year after the purpose expires (with specific extensions tied to legally required records); employer security purpose presumed to expire at termination. [24] | Retain no longer than reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law/court order/retention schedule; (ii) prevent fraud/criminal activity/claims/security threats; or (iii) provide the services for which enrolled. [39] |
| Security | Reasonable standard of care in industry; protections at least as protective as for other confidential/sensitive info. [1] | Reasonable care; protect same as or more than other confidential info held. [24] | Reasonable care to guard against unauthorized access/acquisition. [39] |
| Sale/profit/use limits | No selling, leasing, trading, or “otherwise profiting” from biometrics. [1] | May not sell/lease/disclose except narrow exceptions (e.g., law‑enforcement warrant; completing a requested transaction). [24] | No selling/disclosing for a commercial purpose without consent unless an exception applies (e.g., necessary for requested service or financial transaction; required by law; to a third party that promises no further disclosure/inconsistent enrollment; litigation). [39] |
| Disclosure rules | No disclosure/redisclosure except with consent; to complete a transaction requested/authorized by the subject; as required by law/ordinance; or per valid warrant/subpoena. [1] | Disclosure only under specified exceptions (see above). [24] | Disclosure for commercial purpose only with consent or an exception; vendor must contractually commit to no further disclosure or inconsistent enrollment. [39] |
| Vendor/processor obligations | No prescriptive contract terms in statute; obligations attach to any private entity that “collects, captures, purchases, receives through trade, or otherwise obtains” biometrics. Vendors have been sued as “collectors/obtainers.” [1][16] | CUBI silent on contracts; Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) imposes controller‑processor contract duties for “personal data” (biometric data is sensitive) across consumer contexts. [34][35] | If disclosing to a third party under an exception, require a contract prohibiting further disclosure and inconsistent enrollment for a commercial purpose. [39] |
| Cross‑border sharing | No explicit geographic restriction; disclosure must satisfy § 15(d). [1] | Any disclosure must satisfy statutory exceptions; no geographic carve‑outs. [24] | Same rules apply regardless of recipient location; contract promises required if relying on vendor exception. [39] |
| Recordkeeping | Public, written retention/destruction policy. [1] | None specified (but prudent to retain consent/retention records). [24] | None specified (but must be able to demonstrate “reasonable” retention and vendor contractual controls). [39] |
| Private right of action; class actions | Yes; “any person aggrieved” may sue; class actions common. [4][8] | No private right; AG enforces. [26] | No private right; AG enforces via CPA. [40] |
| Damages/penalties | Liquidated damages: $1,000 (negligent) or $5,000 (intentional/reckless) per violation, or actual damages if greater; fees/costs; injunctive relief. For §15(b) and §15(d), multiple scans/disclosures by the same method (and same recipient for §15(d)) are a single violation per person (Aug. 2, 2024). [4][6] | AG civil penalty up to $25,000 per violation. [24][26] | CPA penalties: up to $7,500 per violation (UDAP); up to $125,000 for violating a CPA injunction; other penalty formulas apply to antitrust. [44] |
| Accrual theory | Pre‑2024: each scan/transmission accrues a claim (Cothron). Post‑Aug. 2, 2024: single‑recovery rule for §15(b)/(d) prospectively; retroactivity unsettled. [6][10] | Not specified; penalties are per violation; AG frames violations in pleadings. [24][29] | Not specified in RCW 19.375; enforcement under CPA UDAP framework. [40][44] |
| Statute of limitations | Five years (all BIPA claims). [9] | None specified in §503.001; AG actions generally not barred by residual 4‑year limitations due to § 16.061. [36] | CPA generally has a 4‑year limitations period; AG actions under CPA are governed by RCW 19.86.120. [45] |
| Cure period/safe harbor | None. [1] | None in CUBI; TDPSA has a 30‑day cure for Chapter 541 (not CUBI). [34][35] | None in RCW 19.375; CPA enforcement applies. [40] |
| Exemptions/defenses | HIPAA non‑conflict; definitional exclusions for HIPAA TPO; GLBA financial institutions; government entities and certain contractors; interplay with labor law (LMRA §301 preemption for union employees). [1][2][11][12] | Financial institutions’ voiceprints exemption; enumerated disclosure exceptions; governmental entities covered separately under Government Code ch. 560; AI‑related training/security exceptions effective Jan. 1, 2026. [24][25][33] | GLBA; HIPAA; law enforcement authority not affected; security purpose carve‑out; AG‑only enforcement. [41][39][40] |
| Technology‑specific notes | Photographs excluded from “biometric identifier,” but “scan of face geometry” is covered; facial recognition deployments commonly litigated. [2] | No modality‑specific restrictions beyond definition; AG has enforced for face recognition and voiceprints. [24][27][29] | “Enroll” concept narrows scope to template/database matching for a “commercial purpose”; security uses excluded. [38][39] |
| Last amended/effective | P.A. 103‑0769, effective Aug. 2, 2024 (Sections 10 and 20). [6][2][4] | H.B. 149 amendments effective Jan. 1, 2026; current text effective until Dec. 31, 2025. [24][25] | Enacted 2017; no amendments since. [37][42] |

## Enforcement and litigation examples

### Illinois (BIPA)

- Workplace/time‑clock and access control  
  - Rogers v. BNSF Railway (auto‑gate fingerprint scans for truck drivers). Jury returned a $228M verdict (later set aside for new trial on damages); ultimately settled for $75M. Allegations: violations of §15(a), §15(b), §15(d) for scans without proper notice/consent/policy. Primary documents: summary‑judgment denial, new‑trial order, settlement website. [14][13][15]  
  - Figueroa v. Kronos (time‑clock vendor liability). Court held plaintiffs plausibly alleged vendor “collects/obtains” biometrics, allowing BIPA claims against a vendor; later resolved via class settlement. Primary opinion; settlement site. [16][17]  
  - NOVAtime time‑clock litigation (vendor settlement). Court‑approved class settlement with distributions in 2024. Settlement site. [18]

- Consumer‑facing/retail  
  - Rosenbach v. Six Flags (thumbprint for season pass). Illinois Supreme Court held a person is “aggrieved” by a BIPA violation without alleging separate actual harm, unlocking broad private enforcement. [8]

- Health‑care context and defenses  
  - Mosby v. Ingalls Memorial Hospital (HIPAA operations carve‑out). Held that biometric data collected from health‑care workers for HIPAA “treatment, payment, or operations” is excluded from BIPA’s “biometric identifier” definition. Implications for medication‑dispensing and clinical access systems. [12]

- Liability contours and exposure  
  - Tims v. Black Horse Carriers (5‑year SOL for all BIPA claims). [9]  
  - Cothron v. White Castle (each scan/transmission accrues a claim); 2024 amendment now limits recovery for §15(b)/(d) to one per person where conditions are met. [10][6]  
  - McDonald v. Symphony Bronzeville Park (workers’ comp exclusivity does not bar BIPA claims). [11]  
  - Walton v. Roosevelt University (LMRA §301 preemption for union employees with CBA management‑rights clauses). [12]  
  - Retroactivity split on the 2024 single‑recovery amendment: some N.D. Ill. courts applied it retroactively; others rejected retroactivity and certified interlocutory appeal (Seventh Circuit review pending as of June 2025). [21][22]

### Texas (CUBI)

- State of Texas v. Meta Platforms (Facebook Tag Suggestions – face recognition)  
  - Allegations: Unauthorized capture/use of face geometry of Texans (users and non‑users) without consent; failure to destroy; DTPA counts. Outcome: $1.4B settlement; final agreed judgment entered July 30, 2024 (payments over five years). Primary press and final judgment. [27][28]

- State of Texas v. Google (Photos Face Grouping; Assistant/Nest voiceprints)  
  - Allegations: Unlawful capture/use of face and voice biometrics without consent; retention/disclosure violations; DTPA counts. Appellate discovery orders in Jan. 2025; settlement in principle announced May 9, 2025 for $1.375B. Primary petition, appellate opinions, and AG settlement release. [29][30][31][32]

- Sector notes  
  - Public AG actions targeting employer time clocks under CUBI are not publicly identified in AG press archives reviewed; employee biometrics remain covered by §503.001’s consent, disclosure, and retention rules, and the employer‑security‑purpose presumption triggers the one‑year destruction clock at termination. [24]

### Washington (RCW 19.375)

- Public AG enforcement explicitly under RCW 19.375 has been rare. The statute is enforced via the CPA; the AG has prioritized other privacy statutes in recent years. Where enforcement occurs, penalties derive from RCW 19.86.140 (e.g., up to $7,500 per UDAP violation). Private class actions under RCW 19.375 are not authorized; plaintiffs sometimes proceed under the CPA independently or under other Washington privacy statutes (notably RCW 19.373 for “consumer health data”), which sits outside the scope of this comparison. [40][44]

## Strategic implications and operational playbook (Illinois, Texas, Washington)

- Harmonize disclosures and consent while respecting state‑specific triggers  
  - Use a unified biometric notice that describes categories collected (e.g., fingerprints, face geometry, voiceprints), purposes, retention terms, security, and sharing practices. In Illinois, obtain a written release (electronic signature acceptable) before any capture; in Texas, ensure advance notice and consent (form not specified); in Washington, for “enrollment” for a commercial purpose, provide notice and obtain consent or offer an opt‑out mechanism. Where uses are purely for “security purpose” in Washington, the notice/consent obligation may not trigger, but assess carefully. [3][6][24][39]

- Policy and retention schedules  
  - Publish and follow an Illinois‑compliant policy with a schedule to destroy biometrics when the initial purpose is satisfied or within 3 years of last interaction—whichever comes first. In Texas, implement destruction within a reasonable time and no later than one year after the purpose expires (e.g., for employer security purposes, the presumption is at termination). In Washington, set “reasonably necessary” periods tied to legal compliance, fraud/security prevention, and service provision. Document retention triggers and deletion. [1][3][24][39]

- Data minimization and technology configuration  
  - Default to on‑device processing where possible; disable “feature storage” or “face grouping” in jurisdictions without consent; geofence features to avoid inadvertent captures in sensitive venues. When deploying face recognition or voice features, surface explicit per‑feature disclosures and consent. Avoid generating “templates” (enrollment) in Washington unless justified by non‑commercial or security purposes. [39]

- Vendor management and contracts  
  - Treat time‑clock/platform vendors as potential “collectors/obtainers” under BIPA (shared liability risk). Include controller‑processor clauses: purpose limitation; adherence to your retention schedule; security controls at least equal to your confidential‑information standard; deletion/return on request; no sale/redisclosure absent your authorization; audit cooperation. In Washington, ensure contracts prohibit further disclosure and any inconsistent enrollment. In Texas, align with TDPSA controller‑processor requirements for personal data even though CUBI does not prescribe them. [1][16][34][35][39]

- Security controls and access management  
  - Encrypt biometric templates at rest and in transit; segregate keys; implement strict RBAC and logging; use liveness detection and anti‑spoofing where applicable; maintain incident response focused on biometric data. BIPA and CUBI both require “reasonable” security and protections at least as strong as for other confidential information. [1][24]

- Workforce training and HR processes  
  - Train managers on consent flows, notice delivery, retention triggers (e.g., termination in Texas), and restrictions on sharing. Bake consent collection and revocation into onboarding/offboarding. In Illinois, ensure written releases are obtained and stored (electronic signatures permissible). [3][6][24]

- Litigation exposure modeling  
  - Illinois: Model damages assuming $1,000/$5,000 per person per claim, not per scan, for §15(b)/(d) violations going forward (Aug. 2, 2024 amendment). Pre‑amendment conduct and retroactivity are jurisdiction‑specific; track Seventh Circuit guidance and Illinois appellate developments. Apply 5‑year SOL; consider LMRA preemption for unionized workforces and HIPAA operations exclusions in clinical environments. [6][9][10][11][12][21][22]  
  - Texas: Model AG exposure at up to $25,000 per violation; recent Big Tech resolutions illustrate multi‑year, billion‑dollar settlements premised on large‑scale capture/retention. [24][27][32]  
  - Washington: Model AG UDAP penalties at up to $7,500 per violation (higher for injunction violations), with focus on whether an “enrollment for a commercial purpose” occurred or whether conduct falls in the security carve‑out. [40][44]

- Insurance and indemnities  
  - Confirm cyber/privacy policies include coverage for statutory privacy violations and explicitly cover biometric claims; evaluate exclusionary language referencing BIPA or statutory damages. Require vendors to carry similar coverage and indemnify for biometric violations (particularly time‑clock and facial recognition vendors). (General statutory frameworks cited above.) [1][16][24][39]

- Monitor for legal changes  
  - Illinois: Track rulings on the retroactivity of P.A. 103‑0769’s single‑recovery rule and any further legislative activity. [6][21][22]  
  - Texas: Prepare for H.B. 149 changes effective Jan. 1, 2026 (AI‑training and security exceptions; consent clarifications). [25]  
  - Washington: Monitor AG activity under RCW 19.375 and related CPA enforcement trends; maintain awareness of adjacent statutes (e.g., HIPAA/GLBA exemptions). [37][41][40][44]

- Intersections that can alter obligations  
  - HIPAA/health‑care: BIPA excludes HIPAA TPO activities; Illinois Supreme Court applied that to certain health‑care worker biometrics (e.g., medication cabinet access). Similar exclusions exist in Washington; align with HIPAA privacy and security rules first. [2][12][41]  
  - GLBA/financial institutions: GLBA carve‑outs present in BIPA and Washington RCW 19.375 (and voiceprint carve‑out in Texas); confirm institutional status and scope. [1][41][24]  
  - Labor law: LMRA §301 can preempt unionized employees’ BIPA claims; ensure CBA coverage and grievance procedures are considered in deployment planning. [12]

## Law‑by‑law compliance checklists

- Illinois (BIPA)  
  - Publish and follow a retention/destruction policy; set a conservative “last interaction” clock. [1]  
  - Before any capture: give written notice of collection/storage, purpose, retention term; obtain written release (electronic signature allowed). [3][6]  
  - Prohibit sale/profit; restrict disclosure to §15(d) exceptions; execute vendor controls accordingly. [1]  
  - Apply reasonable security on par with your most sensitive data. [1]  
  - Track accrual and SOL; preserve consent/notice/retention records >5 years. [9][10]

- Texas (CUBI)  
  - Before capture: inform and obtain consent; log proofs of consent. [24]  
  - Destroy within a reasonable time and no later than one year after the purpose expires (for employees, termination is the presumptive endpoint for security uses). [24]  
  - Do not sell/disclose except under statutory exceptions; maintain a disclosure register. [24]  
  - Protect with reasonable care and at least as protective as other confidential info. [24]  
  - Prepare for Jan. 1, 2026 changes: AI‑training/security exceptions; clarify consent with public media. [25]

- Washington (RCW 19.375)  
  - If “enrolling” for a “commercial purpose,” provide notice and obtain consent or offer an opt‑out mechanism; verify whether the “security purpose” carve‑out applies. [39]  
  - Limit disclosure/sale to consent or enumerated exceptions; require vendor contracts prohibiting further disclosure and inconsistent enrollment. [39]  
  - Retain no longer than reasonably necessary; implement “unenrollment” and deletion. [39]  
  - Maintain reasonable security; refresh consent before material changes. [39]

## Notes on enforceability and effective dates (explicit confirmation)

- Illinois: The ILCS shows Sections 10 and 20 sourced to P.A. 103‑0769, effective Aug. 2, 2024; Sections 15 and 25 remain as enacted. No stays/injunctions or delayed‑effect provisions apply. [2][4][6][5]  
- Texas: The official statutes site shows current §503.001 text “effective until January 01, 2026,” and the H.B. 149 amendments “on January 01, 2026.” No stays/injunctions noted. [24][25]  
- Washington: RCW 19.375 sections cite only 2017 c 299; no amendments or stays are reflected in the official RCW. [37][42]
