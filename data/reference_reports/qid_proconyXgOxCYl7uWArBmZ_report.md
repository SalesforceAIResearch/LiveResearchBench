# Global policy on performance‑enhancing drugs (PEDs) and performance‑enhancing technologies in elite sport

## Executive summary and recommendation
- PEDs: Broad legalization is not advisable. The most credible medical evidence shows substantial health harms for major PED classes (e.g., anabolic steroids, erythropoiesis‑stimulating agents, powerful stimulants), persistent detectability gaps that would convert “permission” into coercion, and binding international law (UNESCO Convention, WADA Code) that precludes legalization within the Olympic/IF ecosystem. Maintain the WADA Code’s prohibition, strengthen harm‑reduction inside the existing framework (e.g., health‑check thresholds, medical safety rules like tramadol bans, smarter TUE governance), fund intelligence‑led enforcement, and address inequities in testing capacity across regions [1][2][3][11][12][13][14][17][18][58][59][62][63][64][65].
- Performance‑enhancing technologies: Allow under strict, sport‑specific homologation that caps biomechanical effects, ensures safety and broad availability (e.g., World Athletics shoe rules, World Aquatics textile suit rule, FIFA/IFAB wearable standards, UCI anti‑fraud inspections). These equipment/biomedical technologies can be net positive when governed to preserve fairness, access, and data rights [19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][53][54][55][56][57][58].

What follows is a structured, evidence‑based table presenting exactly six pro and six con arguments, each with thesis, supporting evidence, analysis, examples, contexts affected, ethical/legal considerations, and primary source links.

## Exactly six pro and six con arguments

| Stance | Thesis | Supporting Evidence (inline citations) | Analysis/Reasoning | Key Examples/Case Studies | Sports/Contexts Affected | Ethical/Legal Considerations | Source URLs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro | Harm‑reduction via supervised thresholds and medical rules can lower health risks compared with clandestine use | UCI introduced a hematocrit “health check” (no‑start >50%) in 1997 amid EPO risks [76]; WADA uses thresholds (e.g., salbutamol ≤1600 μg/24 h; urine >1000 ng/mL presumptive AAF) [3][70][71]; caffeine moved from prohibition to Monitoring (widespread use but low high‑dose prevalence) [4][77]; UCI banned tramadol in‑competition as a medical/safety rule; CAS upheld Quintana’s disqualification [17][18]; TUEs formalize medically necessary use (3,744 new TUEs in 2023) [28][29][30]. | Thresholds and medical rules internalize harm‑reduction without normalizing performance‑driven drug use. Where pharmacology is therapeutically necessary or widely used societally (e.g., asthma, caffeine), a controlled allowance with testing backstops reduces false positives and gaming incentives while protecting health. | Cycling Hct health checks [76]; Salbutamol threshold and Froome case closure (no ADRV) [3][31][70]; UCI tramadol ban and CAS Quintana [17][18]; TUE system scale [29][30]. | Endurance sports (cycling, distance running), team sports with analgesic use, athletes with asthma (beta‑2 agonists) | Consistent with WADA Code and ISTUE; medical necessity versus enhancement; respects UNESCO obligations while targeting health risks [1][2][3][11][28]. | [76] [3] [4] [17] [18] [28] [29] [30] [31] [70] [71] [77] |
| Pro | Enforcement is costly and under‑deterrent; reallocating some resources to athlete health, education, and intelligence could improve outcomes | Global AAF/ADRV rates are low relative to estimated prevalence (e.g., 0.6–1% ADRVs vs. 30–57% past‑year prevalence at elite events using randomized response; 6.5–9.2% among U.S. elites) [5][6][40][41][42]; Anti‑doping costs near $300m/year across sport; per‑test costs commonly $400–$900; WADA budget ~USD 55–58m; US withheld ~$3.6m dues, highlighting fiscal limits [37][38][39][7][8][9][39][40]; ITA’s scale shows growing operational reach but finite capacity (44,400+ samples, 532 potential ADRVs in 2024) [10]. | When detection probability is low and expensive to raise, classical deterrence is limited. Pivoting marginal dollars from blanket testing to targeted I&I, health screening, and education may yield better welfare, while maintaining core compliance to protect clean athletes. | ITA operational figures [10]; WADA budget and U.S. funding dispute [7][8][9]; Cost benchmarks (SIA fees; Paris lab estimate) [38][39][40]; Prevalence‑detection gap [5][6][40][41][42]. | Across Olympic sports and pro leagues; most acute in endurance/power sports with historical doping | Must preserve Code compliance to remain in Olympic ecosystem; shift is within Code (ISTI encourages risk‑based targeting, I&I) [2][36]. | [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] |
| Pro | Transparent regulation of technologies and certain physiological aids can equalize access and reduce hidden advantages | World Athletics caps stack height/plates and mandates availability; recent 20 mm track spike update aims to simplify and improve equity [19][20]; FIFA/IFAB permit EPTS wearables subject to safety/quality approval [25][26]; UCI homologation and anti‑fraud inspections (magnetic/X‑ray/thermal) make tech use transparent [23][24]; World Aquatics regulates swimwear and publishes approved lists [21][22]. | Clear homologation plus availability rules can reduce “prototype” advantage and resource asymmetries while allowing safe innovation. Visibility and approval pathways also reduce off‑book tech arms races. | WA shoe rules [19][20]; FIFA EPTS program [25][26]; UCI tech fraud tests (997 bikes checked, TdF 2023) [24]; World Aquatics swimwear lists [21][22]. | Track and road running, football/soccer, cycling, aquatics | Aligns with Code (tech governance sits with IFs); fairness via availability rules; transparency curbs coercion risks from unseen tech [1][19][21][25]. | [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] |
| Pro | Controlled tech can legitimately improve performance and safety, enhancing sport without drugs | Super‑shoes reduce metabolic cost ~2–4% and redistribute joint work; rules cap effects while enabling progress [52][53][19][20]; Rugby instrumented mouthguards provide near‑real‑time head‑acceleration data under strict specs [27]; UCI cockpit/TT position rules evolve for safety and fairness while allowing aero progress [55]. | Carefully bounded tech improves athlete outputs and can reduce injury risk via better monitoring and safer equipment configurations—benefits that fans and sponsors accept when records remain credible. | RE gains with carbon‑plated footwear [52][53]; World Rugby iMG specs [27]; UCI TT rule adjustments [55]. | Athletics, rugby, cycling, other tech‑forward sports | Requires data‑rights governance (IOC consensus; FIFPRO Charter) to avoid surveillance harms; enforce availability to avoid inequity [56][57]. | [19] [20] [27] [52] [53] [55] [56] [57] |
| Pro | Respecting athlete autonomy within guardrails (medical oversight, data rights) can legitimize beneficial enhancements | Philosophical case for regulated enhancement under medical supervision (Savulescu) [45]; Players’ data rights and IOC data protection frameworks support ethical use of wearables/AI when consent and security are robust [56][57]; Emergence of enhancement‑permissive proposals (Enhanced Games) signals unmet athlete agency/financial needs [46][47][48][49]. | Real autonomy requires fair consent, full risk disclosure, and privacy protections. While drug prohibition remains, governing ethical tech with explicit consent and rights recognizes athlete agency and avoids paternalism in non‑pharmacological enhancement. | FIFPRO Charter [57]; IOC data protection consensus [56]; Enhanced Games debate (backlash and athlete interest) [46][47][48][49]. | Team sports with tracking, endurance sports with wearables, emerging alt‑events | WADA Code prohibits PEDs; athlete autonomy arguments fit better for equipment/data tech than drugs; legal compliance remains determinative for Olympic pathway [1][11][56][57]. | [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [56] [57] |
| Pro | Threshold‑based “clarity” for gray‑area substances reduces disputes and improves trust | Salbutamol thresholds + controlled PK defense reduce false positives; RCTs show no performance gain at permitted inhaled doses [3][70][71]; Froome case resolved on scientific grounds [31]; Caffeine removal to Monitoring avoided criminalizing commonplace, modest use while retaining surveillance [4][77]; UCI’s tramadol approach framed explicitly as health, not anti‑doping ADRV [17][18]. | Bright‑line thresholds + published rationales can turn flashpoints into predictable processes, sustaining legitimacy of anti‑doping while accommodating therapeutic reality. | Salbutamol cases and RCTs [31][70][71]; Caffeine monitoring dataset [77]; Tramadol medical ban (UCI/CAS) [17][18]. | Endurance sports; high‑asthma prevalence sports; pain management contexts | Within Code (List Notes, ISTUE); differentiates medical vs. enhancement uses; consistent with UNESCO obligations [1][3][11][28]. | [3] [4] [17] [18] [28] [31] [70] [71] [77] |
| Con | PEDs carry substantial, well‑documented health risks (cardiac, thrombotic, endocrine, neuropsychiatric) that outweigh sport benefits | AAS: 3‑fold mortality; markedly elevated MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy; long‑term hypogonadism and suppressed spermatogenesis in a subset; autopsy series show hypertrophy/fibrosis and sudden death [58][59][60][61]; ESAs/blood: thromboembolism risk rises (oncology meta‑analysis RR ~1.75); viscosity/hematocrit thresholds linked to acute events; EPO improves VO2max but with mixed field performance and safety concerns [62][63][64][65]; Stimulants can mask fatigue and raise overheating/arrhythmia risks [66][67][68][69]; Diuretics and SARMs carry kidney/electrolyte and hepatotoxic risks [72][73]; Gene‑doping risks include immune complications (autoimmune anemia in primates) [75]. | Legalization would expand exposure to high‑risk pharmacology to keep up competitively, with predictable morbidity/mortality externalities. Medicalization does not neutralize class‑wide risks in healthy athletes. | AAS cohort hazards [58][59][61]; ESA/EPO evidence [62][63][64][65]; Stimulant physiology [66][68]; Cocaine CV risk (for context) [69]; Diuretics/SARMs harms [72][73]; EPO gene therapy macaques [75]. | Strength/power sports; endurance sports; weight‑class and team sports with painkiller/diuretic misuse | WADA List bans major high‑risk classes; CAS/IF medical rules (e.g., tramadol) respond to observed harms; legalization would conflict with duty of care [1][3][17][18]. | [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [72] [73] [75] |
| Con | Legalization would coerce athletes into risky enhancement to remain competitive, undermining fairness | Prevalence far exceeds detection, indicating competitive pressures already push use; legalization would universalize that pressure [5][40][41][42]; State‑sponsored doping (Russia) and under‑age case fallout (Valieva) illustrate systemic coercion dynamics and victimization [14][13][15][16]; UNESCO Convention and WADA Code exist to protect “clean” athletes from such coercion [1][11][12]. | In winner‑take‑most markets, permissive regimes shift norms and increase implicit coercion, especially for youth and precarious athletes, and in under‑resourced systems with fewer medical safeguards. | RUSADA non‑compliance and sanctions; Valieva (retroactive re‑ranking; four‑year ban) [14][13][15][16]. | Global; high‑stakes Olympic sports; youth pipelines | Legal mandates (UNESCO, Code) enshrine fairness/integrity; coercion risk is a core ethical rationale for prohibition [1][11][12]. | [1] [5] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [40] [41] [42] |
| Con | Detectability limits and tech arms races would persist or worsen (e.g., gene/tech doping), eroding integrity | Gene‑doping detection is advancing but faces evasion (codon‑optimised transgenes); WADA lab guidance relies on PCR/NGS with known blind spots [74]; Mechanical doping risk requires constant inspection (UCI magnetic/X‑ray/thermal) [23][24]; ABP can be circumvented and is probabilistic [43][44]; WADA is forced to expand I&I to keep pace [36]. | Legalizing some enhancements does not obviate the need to police the next frontier; it may accelerate R&D to exploit grey areas, increasing monitoring burden and costs. | UCI tech‑fraud program (TdF 2023: 997 bikes tested) [24]; ABP performance impacts and limitations [43][44]; WADA I&I expansion [36]. | Tech‑intensive sports (cycling), endurance sports (ABP) | Code/ISTI require continual adaptation; legalization would not remove integrity costs, and may raise them [1][2]. | [1] [2] [23] [24] [36] [43] [44] [74] |
| Con | Legalization is incompatible with binding global law and the Olympic system | UNESCO Convention (191 States Parties) obliges governments to align with the WADA List/ISTUE; WADA Code harmonizes anti‑doping across IFs/NADOs [11][12][1]; CAS awards and IOC guidance enforce compliance consequences (e.g., RUSADA) [14][13]; IF rules embed equipment/tech standards rather than PED permission [19][21][25]. | Any legalization would force secession from the Olympic/IF ecosystem. That would forfeit access to Olympic Games, IF events, visas, broadcast contracts, and public funding tied to compliance. | RUSADA/CAS enforcement; IF equipment regulations (WA, World Aquatics, IFAB/FIFA) [14][13][19][21][25][26]. | Olympic sports globally | Legal and contractual architecture makes PED legalization infeasible within the current system; compliance affects hosting, funding, and athlete eligibility [1][11][12][13][14]. | [1] [11] [12] [13] [14] [19] [21] [25] [26] |
| Con | Doping scandals erode fan trust and sponsorships, harming sport economics | Sponsors cut ties with Armstrong; DOJ $5m settlement for sponsor deception [78][79]; PED suspension announcements cut MLB team TV audiences ~9% for ~37 days [80]; Over half of UK public report being put off sport by doping stories [81]. | Trust shocks have measurable demand and sponsor effects. Systemic permissiveness risks normalizing suspicion, depressing viewership and partner willingness to invest in the Olympic pathway. | Armstrong sponsor exits and legal settlement [78][79]; MLB TV impact [80]; UK public survey [81]. | Cycling, baseball, and broader Olympic sports via halo effects | Code compliance signals integrity to fans and sponsors; permissive leagues (e.g., “Enhanced Games”) face institutional and reputational headwinds [46][47][48][49]. | [78] [79] [80] [81] [46] [47] [48] [49] |
| Con | Legalization would exacerbate inequity: wealthier systems would purchase safer protocols and better tech, widening outcome gaps | WA had to cap shoes and require availability to curb prototype advantages; Aquatics banned polyurethane suits after record deluge and cost barriers (brands wrote off inventory) [19][20][50][51][52]; FIFA/IFAB restrict EPTS to certified systems to manage safety/access [25][26]; Category‑A testing burdens fall on high‑risk federations, highlighting uneven capacities [33]; Funding asymmetries (e.g., WADA dues disputes) already strain global parity [7][8][9]. | Legal access does not equal practical access. Without robust redistribution, legalization compounds resource advantages (medical supervision, designer compounds, custom tech) and undermines competitive balance, especially across countries. | LZR suit ban and fallout [50][51][52]; WA shoe caps [19][20]; FIFA EPTS approvals [25][26]; Category‑A regime [33]. | Aquatics, athletics, football, lower‑resourced federations | Equity is a core value in the Olympic Charter ethos; legalization without massive redistribution would conflict with fairness principles and human‑rights‑based sport policy [11][19][25]. | [7] [8] [9] [19] [20] [25] [26] [33] [50] [51] [52] |

## Policy framework: what should be allowed, under what conditions

- PEDs
  - Maintain prohibition under the WADA Code and International Standards; do not legalize PEDs in the Olympic/IF ecosystem [1][2][3][11][12].
  - Expand “harm‑reduction within prohibition”:
    - Use medical safety rules and health‑check thresholds (e.g., no‑start hematocrit cut‑offs; in‑competition tramadol bans) across high‑risk contexts [17][18][76].
    - Retain pharmacological thresholds and decision limits for grey‑area therapeutics (e.g., salbutamol), with clear scientific rationales and access to controlled PK studies; periodically review Monitoring Program items (e.g., caffeine, nicotine) [3][4][31][70][71][77].
    - Strengthen TUE governance and transparency: publish annual aggregated TUE metrics by sport/event; enhance independent panels for high‑stakes events [28][29][30].
  - Enforcement modernization and equity:
    - Increase funding for intelligence‑led investigations and ABP, rather than solely test volume; expand WADA I&I regional partnerships [10][36][43][44].
    - Create a solidarity fund to support NADOs/IFs in resource‑constrained regions (testing, ABP, education), minimizing “Category‑A” burden inequities [7][8][9][33].
    - Maintain and update gene‑doping detection (PCR/NGS), lab capability grants, and legal tools to address trafficking [74][75].

- Performance‑enhancing technologies and biomedical/physiological aids
  - Allow with strict homologation and access rules:
    - Equipment standards that cap biomechanical/energetic effects (stack heights, plates, dimensions), with mandatory market availability for elites and prototype control [19][20][21][22][55].
    - Event‑side inspection to deter mechanical/electronic fraud (magnetic/X‑ray/thermal protocols) [23][24].
    - Certified wearable programs (FIFA/IFAB EPTS; World Rugby iMG) tied to safety and data‑quality thresholds [25][26][27].
  - Data governance and athlete rights:
    - Adopt IOC data protection principles and FIFPRO Player Data Rights across all sports using wearables/AI analytics; require informed consent, data minimization, and secure storage [56][57].
  - Access and equity:
    - IF‑managed “availability schemes” and pooled procurement for approved equipment; tech access grants for lower‑resourced NGBs ahead of global championships [19][20][21][22].

- Commercial, legal, and fan‑trust safeguards
  - Preserve alignment with UNESCO Convention and WADA Code to protect Olympic eligibility and sponsor confidence [1][11][12][13][14].
  - Publish plain‑language scientific rationales for List decisions and equipment regulations to sustain legitimacy and mitigate controversy (e.g., salbutamol notes, footwear technical notes) [3][19][21].
