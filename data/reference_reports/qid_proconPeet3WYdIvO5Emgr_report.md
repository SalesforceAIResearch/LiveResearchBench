# Should the U.S. Raise the Federal Minimum Wage to $15 in 2025?

## Executive Summary

- Central tradeoff: A $15 federal minimum wage would deliver large pay increases to tens of millions at the bottom of the wage distribution and reduce lower-tail inequality; the best federal scorekeepers and leading studies project modest-to-moderate employment risks, concentrated among teens, less-experienced workers, and in lower-wage regions and small firms. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates net pay gains of roughly $333 billion for affected workers, 0.9 million fewer people in poverty, and a median employment decline of about 1.3–1.4 million if the policy were in place by 2025 [The Budgetary Effects of the Raise the Wage Act of 2021](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1]; [The Effects on Employment and Family Income of Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410)[2].
- Distributional effects: Strong evidence that minimum wage increases compress the bottom of the wage distribution with small spillovers above the new floor and little net loss of low-wage jobs in aggregate (Cengiz–Dube–Lindner–Zipperer, QJE 2019), though heterogeneity by subgroup and place matters [The Effect of Minimum Wages on Low-Wage Jobs](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905)[3]; [The Contribution of the Minimum Wage to US Wage Inequality over Three Decades: A Reassessment](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20140073)[4].
- Anti-poverty and fiscal: Credible estimates show poverty reductions ranging from hundreds of thousands (CBO) to several million (modeling based on Dube’s elasticities), with lower spending on SNAP and some refundable tax credits partially offset by higher unemployment insurance and public health program costs; CBO projects a net federal deficit increase of about $54 billion over 10 years [The Budgetary Effects of the Raise the Wage Act of 2021](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1]; [Minimum wages and family incomes](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20171155)[7]; [Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025…](https://www.epi.org/publication/raising-the-federal-minimum-wage-to-15-by-2025-would-lift-the-pay-of-32-million-workers/)[8]; [A $15 minimum wage would have significant and direct effects on the federal budget](https://www.epi.org/publication/a-15-minimum-wage-would-have-significant-and-direct-effects-on-the-federal-budget/)[11]; [SNAP enrollment and minimum wage](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irel.12110)[10].
- Prices and pass-through: Price effects appear modest and concentrated in low-wage services (e.g., restaurants), with estimated pass-through in the low single digits after large hikes, and some increases in Medicare/Medicaid costs via higher provider wages [Does a Minimum Wage Increase Affect Prices?](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2r84736j)[26]; [The Budgetary Effects of the Raise the Wage Act of 2021](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1].
- Jurisdictional experience: Cities and states that reached or moved toward $15 (NYC, SF Bay Area, Seattle, California statewide) generally saw large wage gains; aggregate employment effects in food service are often near zero in high-quality multi-city studies, though specific studies (e.g., Seattle) found hours reductions at some firms and for some workers [Minimum wage impacts on food service and other low-wage sectors](https://irle.berkeley.edu/minimum-wage-impacts-on-employment-in-food-service-and-other-low-wage-sectors-of-the-us-economy/)[25]; [Seattle Minimum Wage Study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23532)[23].
- Design matters: Employment risks rise with the bite of the policy, the share of workers affected, and the speed of phase-in; indexation improves predictability but increases long-run bite; regional adjustments, tipped wage treatment, and enforcement capacity shape outcomes [Factors Affecting the Employment Effects of Minimum Wages](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57049)[33]; [Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/15-tipped-employees-flsa/)[34].

Recommendation frame: Whether to raise the federal minimum to $15 in 2025 depends on how policymakers weigh distributional gains against employment risks and on design choices (phase-in, indexation, regional/tipped adjustments). Evidence suggests that a carefully phased and enforced $15 floor—ideally paired with EITC expansions—would substantially raise incomes at the bottom and reduce poverty and inequality, with employment risks that are real but likely manageable in aggregate, while acknowledging concentrated risks for some groups and places.

## Comparative Outcomes and Heterogeneity

- High-cost metros vs low-wage regions: Cities such as New York City and San Francisco absorbed $15 with robust restaurant growth and minimal aggregate job loss in food service [Minimum wage impacts on food service…](https://irle.berkeley.edu/minimum-wage-impacts-on-employment-in-food-service-and-other-low-wage-sectors-of-the-us-economy/)[25]; [New York City’s $15 minimum wage](https://www.centernyc.org/new-york-citys-15-minimum-wage)[27]. Lower-wage regions and rural areas face tighter margins and higher bindingness; CBO expects larger employment responses where a higher share of workers are affected [The Effects on Employment and Family Income…](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410)[2].
- Industry differences: Restaurants and long-term care are the most exposed. Food service shows sizable wage gains, small price increases, and mixed employment estimates across designs; long-term care and home health face higher public program costs (Medicaid/Medicare) as wages rise [The Budgetary Effects…](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1]; [Price Pass-Through](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2r84736j)[26].
- Firm size: Small, low-wage firms with limited pricing power are more exposed; larger multi-unit employers may adjust via prices, scheduling, and technology. Business group analyses project disproportionate impacts on small firms; credible academic evidence also points to greater substitution away from automatable low-skill tasks when wage floors rise [NFIB Massachusetts study](https://www.nfib.com/news/news/massachusetts-study-commissioned-by-nfib-finds-20-minimum-wage-will-disproportionately-harm-smaller-businesses/)[30]; [People Versus Machines](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0019793917747273)[36].
- Subgroups: Teens and less-experienced workers show the most consistent employment sensitivity; recent studies also link large hikes to small reductions in community college enrollment (especially part-time students) [FRBSF Economic Letter](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2015/12/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/)[35]; [Community college enrollment](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2023/beyond-bls/increases-in-minimum-wage-decrease-community-college-enrollment.htm)[19].
- Compliance and enforcement: Raising the floor without adequate enforcement risks noncompliance and wage theft, which already costs workers billions annually; enforcement resources and simple, well-communicated rules (including tipped wage policy) help ensure intended gains are realized [Employers steal billions from workers’ pay](https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-pay/)[37]; [Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/15-tipped-employees-flsa/)[34].

## Federal/State Budget and Safety Net Interactions

- Federal budget: CBO’s 2021 score for a $15 minimum by 2025 projects a net 10-year deficit increase of $54B: savings from SNAP and refundable credits offset by higher UI and health program spending, with net revenues rising modestly [The Budgetary Effects of the Raise the Wage Act of 2021](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1].
- Safety net: SNAP caseloads and outlays decline as earnings rise; EITC/CTC outlays shrink on the outlay side, while Medicaid/CHIP/marketplace subsidies and Medicare rise partly due to higher sectoral prices and coverage transitions [SNAP enrollment and minimum wage](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irel.12110)[10]; [The Budgetary Effects…](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975)[1].
- Health insurance: Employer offers modestly decline after hikes, but overall uninsurance need not rise when Medicaid/marketplace coverage is available [Minimum wage and employer insurance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37897833/)[12]; [Raising minimum wage in New Jersey…](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/raising-minimum-wage-new-jersey-implications-earnings-and-medicaid-eligibility-and-enrollment)[13].
- State/local budgets: Payroll costs rise for state/local employers, especially in low-wage states (e.g., Florida’s projected increases for schools/local governments during its path to $15) [Florida Amendment 2 analysis (EDR summary)](https://reason.org/voters-guide/florida-ballot-initiative-analysis-amendment-2-2020/)[32].

## Design Choices That Shape Outcomes

- Phase-in pace and indexation: Slower, predictable phase-ins reduce adjustment frictions; automatic CPI indexation provides certainty but increases long-run bite; both affect employment responses [Factors Affecting the Employment Effects of Minimum Wages](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57049)[33].
- Regional calibration: A uniform national $15 binds more tightly in low-wage regions; options include regional floors or temporary sub-minima for smaller, rural employers to limit concentrated disemployment risks, while maintaining a clear path to parity [The Effects on Employment and Family Income…](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55410)[2].
- Tipped wage policy: The federal cash wage for tipped workers ($2.13) and state-level tip credits complicate incidence, compliance, and earnings stability; phasing toward “one fair wage” or raising the tipped cash wage meaningfully changes restaurant-sector dynamics [Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/15-tipped-employees-flsa/)[34].
- Complements: Pairing higher minimums with EITC expansions enhances anti-poverty targeting; robust enforcement (and simple rules) curbs wage theft and preserves intended pay increases [EITC and the minimum wage work together](https://www.epi.org/publication/eitc-and-minimum-wage-work-together/)[14]; [Employers steal billions from workers’ pay](https://www.epi.org/publication/employers-steal-billions-from-workers-pay/)[37].
- Mitigation for at-risk groups: Youth/learner sub-rates, hiring credits, or targeted training/apprenticeships can buffer entry-level opportunities, especially in low-wage regions, while preserving the general floor [FRBSF Economic Letter: Effects on Employment](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2015/12/effects-of-minimum-wage-on-employment/)[35].

## Conclusion

A federal $15 minimum wage by 2025 would markedly raise earnings for low-wage workers, compress wage inequality at the bottom, and reduce poverty—benefits confirmed by CBO and leading academic research. The principal costs are moderate employment risks, concentrated among teens, less-experienced workers, and in lower-wage regions and small firms; modest price pass-through in services; and a small net increase in the federal deficit, driven by higher UI and health program outlays. Jurisdictional experiences (NYC, SF Bay Area, Seattle) show that reaching $15 can be done without broad job losses in high-cost metros, though heterogeneity is substantial.

If adopted, policy design should smooth the phase-in, consider regional calibration, clarify and enforce tipped wage rules, pair with EITC expansions, and invest in enforcement and targeted supports for youth and small businesses in low-wage areas. With these safeguards, the balance of evidence supports the view that the distributional gains would outweigh the aggregate employment costs.
