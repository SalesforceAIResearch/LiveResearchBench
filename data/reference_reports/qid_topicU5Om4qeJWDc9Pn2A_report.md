# Ultra-processed foods (UPFs), causal pathways, susceptibility, and policies: what the best current evidence shows

## Executive summary

- Definition and exposure: NOVA defines UPFs as industrial formulations made mostly or entirely from substances not commonly used in culinary preparations, often with cosmetic additives and industrial processing such as extrusion and pre-frying, designed for hyper-palatability, convenience, and long shelf life [1]. In the US, UPFs provide most dietary energy and have increased over time among adults (53.5% to 57.0% of energy, 2001–2018) and youth (61.4% to 67.0%, 1999–2018), with larger increases among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American youth [2][3]. Globally, UPF shares are highest in the US/UK and lower in Mediterranean countries, with marked heterogeneity by region and country income level [4]. Recent US data (Aug 2021–Aug 2023) suggest modest declines from 2017–2018 levels (youth 61.9%; adults 53.0%) [5]. In small-island states such as Fiji, UPFs already contribute materially to adult energy intake (~21.5%) and to sugar/sodium intake [6].
- Causal intake pathway: A tightly controlled inpatient randomized crossover feeding trial showed that ad libitum ultra-processed diets increased energy intake by ~500 kcal/day and caused weight gain compared with nutrient-matched unprocessed diets; faster eating and higher energy density explained part of the excess intake [7]. Across diverse dietary patterns, ad libitum meal energy intake increases independently with higher energy density, faster eating rate, and a greater proportion of hyper-palatable foods [8]. Experimental meta-analyses show large, near-linear reductions in daily energy intake when energy density is lowered and meaningful intake reductions when served portions are downsized [9][10]. Texture manipulations that slow eating rate reduce meal energy intake, with “soft ultra-processed” meals increasing intake relative to “hard minimally processed” versions in randomized crossover testing [11].
- Commercial drivers of overconsumption: A quantitative definition identifies three nutrient clusters characterizing “hyper-palatable” foods common in UPFs (fat+salt; fat+sugar; refined carbohydrate+salt), with 62% of items in the US national database meeting criteria; the share of hyper-palatable items rose from 49% to 69% between 1988 and 2018 [12][13]. End-of-aisle displays function like substantial implicit price discounts, increasing category sales by ~24–114% independent of posted price/promotions [14]. Supermarket promotions produce larger sales uplifts in less-healthy categories and can be more pronounced among higher-SES households [15][16].
- Marketing, especially to children and in digital environments: Experimental evidence shows that food marketing causes children to eat more immediately and shifts preferences and choices toward promoted items; a meta-analysis found increased intake (SMD ~0.25) and higher odds of choosing advertised foods (OR ~1.77) [17]. Influencer marketing increases children’s snack intake by ~96 kcal in randomized trials [18], and advergames raise immediate intake of energy-dense snacks [19]. Objective screen-capture monitoring estimates thousands of annual digital food marketing exposures per child/adolescent, the vast majority for less-healthy products, with adolescents more exposed [20][21]. WHO Europe provides protocols and a regulatory framework for monitoring and restricting cross-platform digital marketing to minors [22].
- Effective policies and natural experiments: Mexico’s national excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) reduced purchases of taxed beverages by 5.5% in year 1 and 9.7% in year 2 (largest reductions among low-SES households), with small increases in untaxed beverages [23]. The UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) led to large reformulation and reductions in sugars sold from soft drinks (about 30% reduction 2015–2018), with an official review citing ~46% average sugar reduction by 2020 [24][25]; downstream, child hospital admissions for carious tooth extractions fell by ~12% relative to the counterfactual following the SDIL announcement/implementation, with the largest relative reductions among under-10s and across deprivation strata [26]. Chile’s 2016 comprehensive law combining front-of-pack warning labels, marketing restrictions to children, and school sales bans cut the share of TV ads for “high-in” products and reduced children’s exposure to such ads within a year [27][28].
- Equity and susceptibility: Children/adolescents are more responsive to marketing and are more heavily exposed in digital contexts [17][20][21]. US youth UPF exposure rose most among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American youth [3]. In policy evaluations, relative purchase reductions were largest among lower-SES households after Mexico’s SSB tax [23], and SDIL-related oral health benefits were observed across deprivation groups [26]. In online retail, some nudges improved basket healthfulness among shoppers from deprived neighborhoods [29].
- Evidence gaps: Strong causal evidence links UPF product design and commercial environments to excess energy intake and near-term health outcomes (e.g., dental hospitalizations), but longer-term trials on chronic disease endpoints, additive/processing-specific mechanisms in humans, and robust evaluations of digital marketing restrictions and in-store promotion/placement policies (including equity impacts) remain limited [8][9][10][14][16][22].

## Definitions, exposure metrics, and global patterns

- NOVA classifies UPFs (group 4) as industrial formulations with ingredients not commonly used in home cooking (e.g., protein isolates, modified starches), cosmetic additives (e.g., flavorings, colorants, emulsifiers), and processes like extrusion and pre-frying, with branding, convenience, and long shelf-life as core features [1].
- Exposure metrics used in epidemiologic and policy studies include:
  - Percentage of dietary energy from UPFs via 24-hour recalls coded by NOVA (e.g., US adult and youth trend studies) [2][3].
  - Household scanner purchases by taxed/untaxed or display/promotion conditions (e.g., Mexico’s SSB tax; end-of-aisle display analyses) [23][14].
  - Objective counts of digital marketing exposures via screen capture per child/adolescent per year [20].
- Trends:
  - US adults: UPF share of energy rose from 53.5% to 57.0% (2001–2018), while minimally processed foods declined from 32.7% to 27.4% [2].
  - US youth (2–19 y): UPF share increased from 61.4% to 67.0% (1999–2018), with larger increases among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American youth [3].
  - Global: Highest UPF shares in the US/UK and lower shares in Mediterranean countries such as Italy (~10%), with worldwide heterogeneity [4].
  - Recent US update: Aug 2021–Aug 2023 means were 61.9% (youth) and 53.0% (adults), modestly lower than 2017–2018 [5].
  - Small island states: Fiji adults obtained ~21.5% of energy from UPFs, with large contributions to sugar and sodium intakes [6].

## Causal pathways: from product design and processing to excess intake and weight gain

- Inpatient randomized crossover trial (28 days, n=20): an ultra-processed diet caused ~500 kcal/day higher intake and significant weight gain compared with an unprocessed diet matched for calories, macronutrients, sugar, sodium, and fiber; eating rate and energy density explained part of the excess energy intake [7].
- Across diverse diets (unprocessed, ultra-processed, low-fat, low-carbohydrate), ad libitum meal energy intake increases independently with higher energy density, faster eating rate, and higher proportion of hyper-palatable foods, highlighting robust intake drivers engineered into many UPFs [8].
- Energy density is a causal lever: lowering dietary energy density produces large, near-linear reductions in daily energy intake in controlled feeding studies and short-term trials, even when macronutrients are held constant [9].
- Portion size is a causal lever: downsizing served portions reduces daily energy intake by about 235 kcal on average in experimental studies, with larger reductions producing larger intake changes; limited evidence suggests smaller portions attenuate weight gain [10].
- Texture and eating rate matter: randomized crossover manipulation of processing level and texture found that “soft ultra-processed” meals increased energy intake by ~300 kcal versus “hard minimally processed” meals; harder textures slowed eating rates and reduced intake [11].
- Hyper-palatability is prevalent and increasing: a quantitative algorithm identified three nutrient clusters typical of hyper-palatable foods (fat+salt; fat+sugar; refined carbohydrate+salt), present in 62% of items in the US food database; availability increased from 49% to 69% between 1988 and 2018 [12][13].

Note on biological mechanisms beyond eating behavior: NOVA emphasizes the common use of cosmetic additives (e.g., emulsifiers, flavorings) and industrial processing (e.g., extrusion, ultra-high temperature processing); however, definitive human causal evidence that isolates specific additives/processing techniques and links them to metabolic or neuroendocrine outcomes independent of diet composition is still emerging relative to the strong intake-behavior mechanisms above [1][7][8][9][11].

## Commercial determinants of eating: pricing, placement, convenience, and marketing

- Promotions and placement:
  - End-of-aisle displays substantially increase category sales independent of price/promotions, with effects equivalent to large implicit price cuts (e.g., 24–114% sales increases across beverages) [14].
  - UK household scanner data show that promotions produce larger sales uplifts in less-healthy categories and larger uplifts among higher-SES households in some analyses [15]; a systematic review indicates context-specific prevalence of promotions with many studies showing stronger promotion depth/responsiveness for less-healthy categories [16].
- Digital choice architecture and retail nudges:
  - In a real online supermarket serving shoppers from deprived neighborhoods, multi-arm nudges (salience, labeling, positioning) improved the healthfulness of baskets among deprived-area shoppers, though not overall, suggesting equity-relevant heterogeneity in responsiveness [29].
  - In a large simulated online grocery RCT with many low-income adults, prefilled “healthy default” carts and 50% discounts on fruits/vegetables increased the share of spending on eligible fruits/vegetables, with additive effects when combined [30].
  - Trials of prefilled default carts among low-income or food-insecure shoppers improved basket healthfulness (e.g., higher HEI-2015, lower energy density) versus education-only controls [31][32].
- Marketing and children’s diets:
  - Meta-analysis of 96 studies (80 meta-analyzed) shows that exposure to food marketing increases immediate energy intake (SMD ~0.25), and increases choice and preference for promoted foods among children; evidence on body weight is more limited but indicates increased purchase requests and pester power [17].
  - Influencer marketing increased children’s snack intake by ~96 kcal compared with non-food posts in a randomized trial [18].
  - Advergames increased children’s immediate intake of energy-dense snacks in randomized trials [19].
- Digital exposure scale and governance:
  - Objective screen-capture monitoring in Canada estimated ~4,067 food/beverage marketing exposures per child per year and ~8,301 per adolescent per year across platforms; ~90% promoted less-healthy products; social media was dominant [20]. Adolescents were substantially more exposed than younger children in related research [21].
  - WHO Europe’s CLICK framework provides standardized monitoring and regulatory guidance for cross-platform digital marketing to children/adolescents, highlighting the need for comprehensive, platform-wide restrictions given personalization and algorithmic targeting [22].

## Health outcomes and equity: what is known from causal and natural experiments

- Energy intake and short-term weight change:
  - The inpatient RCT showed UPF diets cause excess energy intake and weight gain over weeks, mediated partly by energy density and eating rate [7].
- Dental health:
  - After the UK’s SDIL was announced and implemented, interrupted time-series analyses found an approximately 12% relative reduction in hospital admissions for carious tooth extractions among children compared with counterfactual trends, with the largest relative reductions among under-10s and benefits observed across deprivation strata [26].
- Purchases and reformulation:
  - Mexico’s SSB tax reduced taxed beverage purchases by 5.5% in year one and 9.7% in year two (average −7.6% over two years), with the largest reductions among low-SES households and modest increases in untaxed beverages [23].
  - The UK SDIL led to substantial reformulation and reductions in sugars sold from soft drinks at the market level (about 30% reduction 2015–2018), with an official review reporting ~46% average sugar reduction from 2015 to 2020 [24][25].
  - Chile’s 2016 law combining “high-in” front-of-pack warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and school sales bans led to sharp reductions in the volume and content of TV advertising for “high-in” products and reduced children’s exposure to such ads within a year; later daytime TV bans further reduced exposure [27][28].
- Equity:
  - Low-income households in Mexico reduced taxed beverage purchases the most following the SSB tax [23].
  - SDIL-associated dental benefits were observed across deprivation groups, with the largest relative reductions among younger children [26].
  - UPF shares increased most among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American youth in the US (1999–2018), underscoring equity concerns in exposure trends [3].
  - In online retail, some nudges preferentially benefited shoppers from deprived neighborhoods [29].

## Heterogeneity and effect modification

- Age: Children/adolescents show stronger immediate intake responses to marketing and are more exposed to digital marketing than younger children [17][20][21].
- Socioeconomic status: Promotion uplifts can be larger among higher-SES households, whereas excise tax responses (Mexico) showed larger relative purchase reductions among low-SES households; SDIL dental benefits accrued across deprivation strata [15][23][26].
- Ethnicity: In the US, increases in UPF energy share since 1999 were largest among non-Hispanic Black and Mexican American youth [3].
- Country income level/urbanicity: Global UPF exposure is highest in high-income countries and rising in many middle-income settings with retail modernization and aggressive marketing, as reflected in comparative reviews and country case studies [4][6].

## Policy options most likely to reduce UPF exposure, mitigate health risks, and improve equity

- Fiscal policies targeting UPF-rich categories (e.g., SSBs):
  - Excise taxes reduce purchases and shift consumption toward untaxed options, with equity-positive patterns in some settings (e.g., larger relative reductions among low-SES households in Mexico) [23].
  - Tiered levies that create strong reformulation incentives (e.g., UK SDIL) can reduce sugars sold and deliver downstream health gains (reduced pediatric dental extractions), with benefits across deprivation strata [24][25][26].
- Marketing restrictions and front-of-pack warnings:
  - Comprehensive, multi-component approaches (Chile) combining strong front-of-pack warnings with child-directed marketing bans and school sales restrictions reduce marketing exposure and shift the advertising landscape away from high-in products; such packages are promising for reducing UPF appeal and demand among children [27][28].
  - Digital-specific monitoring and restrictions are needed given high volumes of cross-platform exposure; WHO Europe provides technical guidance to implement platform-wide protections [22].
- Retail environments (placement and promotions):
  - Restricting high-salience placements (e.g., end-of-aisle) for UPF-rich categories should lower sales given large causal placement effects akin to price discounts [14].
  - Regulating price promotions that disproportionately uplift less-healthy categories may reduce UPF purchasing, with attention to SES differences in promotion responsiveness [15][16].
  - Evidence-informed online nudges and default options can improve basket healthfulness, with some indications of greater benefits among deprived shoppers; pairing defaults with targeted discounts enhances effects [29][30][31][32].
- Product design levers:
  - Intake is causally driven by energy density, eating rate, and hyper-palatability; policies that incentivize reformulation to lower energy density and slow eating rate (e.g., texture, portion standards in public procurement) can reduce ad libitum intake even without changing macronutrient targets [8][9][10][11][24][25].

## Measurement and evaluation guidance

- Exposure measures:
  - Use standardized NOVA coding of 24-hour recalls to compute % energy from UPFs, enabling trend and equity analyses by sociodemographic groups [2][3][4][5].
  - Combine scanner data (price, promotions, placement) with causal identification strategies for retail interventions (e.g., end-of-aisle restrictions), acknowledging large placement elasticities [14][15][16].
  - Implement WHO-style screen-capture protocols to quantify cross-platform digital marketing exposures in children/adolescents and link to diet outcomes [20][22].
- Outcome measures:
  - Short-term causal trials should include ad libitum intake, eating rate, satiety and reward-related measures, and body weight; randomized feeding designs show high internal validity for UPF-related intake mechanisms [7][8][9][10][11].
  - Natural experiments with robust time-series counterfactuals are well-suited to evaluate policy impacts on purchases, reformulation, and downstream health (e.g., dental admissions) [23][24][25][26][27][28].

## Key uncertainties and priorities for research

- Additives and processing-specific biology: Human trials isolating specific processing technologies (e.g., extrusion, ultra-high temperature processing) and common additives (e.g., emulsifiers, non-nutritive sweeteners) with outcomes in metabolic health, gut microbiome, appetite hormones, inflammatory markers, neuroendocrine signaling, and brain-reward circuitry are needed to complement strong intake-behavior evidence [1][7][8][9][11].
- Digital marketing restrictions: Longitudinal evaluations linking platform-wide restrictions and exposure reductions to changes in children’s diets, weight trajectories, and equity outcomes are priorities; WHO monitoring frameworks can support standardized measurement [22].
- Retail promotion/placement bans: More quasi-experiments and policy evaluations on promotions and high-salience placements (including equity analyses) would strengthen the case for comprehensive retail regulation, given large causal effects observed for individual levers [14][15][16].
- Long-term health outcomes: While short-term RCTs demonstrate causal intake and weight effects, longer-duration trials and well-measured cohorts with NOVA exposures and intermediate biomarkers are needed to clarify causal pathways to chronic disease endpoints across diverse populations [2][3][4][7][8][9][10][11].
