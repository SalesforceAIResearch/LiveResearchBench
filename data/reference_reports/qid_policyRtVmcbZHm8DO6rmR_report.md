# Cross-Industry Comparative Analysis of ESG/Climate Disclosure Frameworks: U.S. SEC Rule, EU CSRD/ESRS, and California’s Climate Laws (SB 253/SB 261)

## Executive Summary and California “SB‑219” Correction

- California’s Senate Bill 219 (2024) is not a standalone climate disclosure regime. It is a 2024 amendments bill that modifies California’s two core climate disclosure statutes: SB 253 (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act) and SB 261 (Climate‑Related Financial Risk Act) [1]. The operative California climate disclosure laws are codified at California Health & Safety Code §§ 38532 (SB 253) and 38533 (SB 261), as amended by SB 219 [2][3].  
- This analysis therefore compares:  
  1) the U.S. SEC climate‑related disclosure rule (adopted March 6, 2024; stayed pending judicial review) [4][5][6][7][8];  
  2) the EU CSRD and ESRS Set 1 (in force with phased application and subsequent postponements) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]; and  
  3) California SB 253 (GHG emissions) and SB 261 (climate‑related financial risk), as amended by SB 219 (2024) [1][2][3][18][19][20][21][22].

## Plain-English Purpose and Scope (Short Descriptions)

- U.S. SEC Climate Rule: Requires public companies (SEC “registrants,” including foreign private issuers) to disclose material climate‑related risks, governance, strategy, risk management, and—only for large accelerated filers and accelerated filers, and only if material—Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 GHG emissions, with phased third‑party assurance; includes specific climate‑related financial statement note disclosures. The rule is currently stayed pending judicial review and agency action [4][5][6][7][8].  
- EU CSRD/ESRS: Requires in‑scope EU and certain non‑EU companies to publish a standardized sustainability statement in the management report per ESRS, using “double materiality” (impacts and financial materiality). ESRS E1 requires Scope 1, Scope 2 (location‑ and market‑based), and relevant Scope 3 GHG emissions, transition plans, scenario analysis, targets, and anticipated financial effects, subject to phase‑ins. Assurance is mandatory (limited initially), with digital tagging to follow. Timelines for some cohorts and sector/third‑country standards have been postponed [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17].  
- California SB 253/SB 261: SB 253 requires large companies “doing business in California” to annually disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 (from 2026), and Scope 3 (from 2027, on a schedule set by CARB) GHG emissions measured under the GHG Protocol, with phased assurance and penalties; SB 261 requires biennial climate‑related financial risk reports aligned with TCFD or an equivalent such as IFRS S2, with penalties for non‑filing. CARB is developing implementing regulations and has issued FAQs, workshops, and initial guidance; litigation is ongoing but no injunction is in place as of Sept. 16, 2025 [1][2][3][18][19][20][21][22][23][24].

## Side-by-Side Comparison (Table-Ready)

| Dimension | U.S. SEC Climate Rule | EU CSRD + ESRS | California SB 253 (GHG) + SB 261 (Risk) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Applicability thresholds (entity type; public/private; revenue/size; doing-business; extraterritorial) | Applies to SEC “registrants” (domestic and foreign private issuers) filing annual reports (Forms 10‑K, 20‑F). Asset‑backed issuers excluded [4]. Scopes 1–2 required only for LAFs/AFs if material; SRCs/EGCs exempt [4][5]. | Applies to EU “large” undertakings and groups, EU‑listed companies (incl. listed SMEs, excluding micro), certain credit institutions and insurers; and to non‑EU groups meeting EU turnover triggers via subsidiaries/branches [9][12]. “Large”: ≥2 of 3—≥250 employees; >€25m balance sheet; >€50m net turnover (post‑2023 update) [16]. Third‑country groups: >€150m EU net turnover plus an EU large or EU‑listed (non‑micro) subsidiary, or an EU branch >€40m, reporting from FY2028 [12][15]. | SB 253: U.S. entities “doing business in CA” with total annual revenues >$1 billion [2]. SB 261: “doing business in CA” with total annual revenues >$500 million; insurers excluded [3]. “Doing business” expected to align to CA Rev. & Tax. Code §23101 tests (sales/property/payroll thresholds) per CARB concept; revenue interpreted as “gross receipts” under §25120(f)(2) (pending rulemaking) [19][20][21]. SB 219 allows consolidated parent‑level reporting [1]. |
| Required disclosure scope | Governance (board/management), strategy (material impacts; if used: transition plan, scenario analysis, internal carbon price), risk management, targets/goals (if set); Scopes 1–2 GHG only for LAF/AF if material; financial statement notes on severe weather/other natural conditions, with thresholds [4]. No Scope 3 requirement [5]. | ESRS 1/2 cross‑cutting; topical ESRS incl. E1 Climate: transition plan, policies, actions/resources, targets, energy, gross Scopes 1–3 and total, removals/credits, internal carbon price, anticipated financial effects; scenario analysis and resilience, governance, and IRO coverage across ESRS 2 [10][11]. Requires GHG Protocol‑consistent methods (Scope 2 Guidance; Scope 3 Standard) per ESRS AR [10][11]. | SB 253: Annual public disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 (from 2026) and Scope 3 (from 2027 on CARB schedule), measured under the GHG Protocol; CARB may update post‑2033 to recognize a global alternative [2]. SB 261: Biennial climate‑related financial risk report aligned with TCFD or equivalent, including IFRS S2 [3][22]. |
| Reporting timelines and phase‑ins | Fact Sheet (now stayed): LAF—S‑K/S‑X FYB 2025; emissions FYB 2026; limited assurance FYB 2029; reasonable assurance FYB 2033. AF—S‑K/S‑X FYB 2026; emissions FYB 2028; limited assurance FYB 2031. SRCs/EGCs/NAFs—S‑K/S‑X FYB 2027; no emissions [5]. Emissions may be filed later (10‑Q/20‑F amendment) [4]. Rule currently stayed [6][7][8]. | Original CSRD cohorts: Wave 1 PIEs >500 employees FY2024; Wave 2 other large undertakings FY2025; Wave 3 listed SMEs (excl. micro) FY2026 [9]. “Stop‑the‑clock” postponement moved Wave 2 to FY2027 and Wave 3 to FY2028; Wave 1 unchanged [13][17]. Non‑EU groups report for FY2028 [12][15]. Sector‑specific and third‑country ESRS adoption deadline moved to June 30, 2026 [14][15][17]. 2025 “quick‑fix” DA extends certain reliefs for Wave 1 FY2025–2026 (under scrutiny) [11]. | SB 253: Scopes 1–2 first due in 2026; Scope 3 first due in 2027 on a CARB‑set schedule (as amended by SB 219) [1][2]. CARB proposed June 30, 2026 concept for first Scopes 1–2 deadline (non‑binding to date) [23]. SB 261: first risk report due Jan. 1, 2026, then biennially; CARB to collect URLs Dec. 1, 2025–Jul. 1, 2026 [3][22]. CARB signaled enforcement discretion for first Scopes 1–2 cycle (Dec. 5, 2024 notice) [18]. |
| Materiality definitions/thresholds | U.S. securities law materiality; information is material if there is a substantial likelihood a reasonable investor would consider it important; applies across S‑K items. Emissions required only if material (LAF/AF) [4]. | ESRS uses “double materiality”: impact materiality and financial materiality; entities must perform and document a double‑materiality assessment; no universal numeric threshold [10]. | SB 253 uses no materiality filter for emissions; Scopes 1–3 must be disclosed per GHG Protocol [2]. SB 261 centers on “climate‑related financial risk” (material risk to financial outcomes from physical/transition risks) and measures to mitigate/adapt, aligned to TCFD/IFRS S2 [3]. |
| Data verification/assurance | LAF/AF emissions assurance phased: limited → reasonable (LAFs) per schedule; provider need not be PCAOB‑registered; must meet independence/qualification criteria and use publicly available, due‑process standards (e.g., ISAE 3000/3410; AICPA SSAE) [4]. | Mandatory external assurance over sustainability reporting: initially limited assurance; Commission to adopt EU assurance standards (deadline Oct. 1, 2026 for limited; feasibility for reasonable by Oct. 1, 2028), with CEAOB non‑binding guidance in the interim; Member States may allow accredited IASPs equivalent to Audit Directive [12][15][24]. Commission has proposed revisiting the assurance trajectory in 2025 simplification package (pending) [25]. | SB 253: Third‑party assurance for Scopes 1–2 at limited assurance from 2026 and reasonable assurance from 2030; CARB may require Scope 3 assurance at limited assurance from 2030. Provider qualifications to be defined/updated by CARB; details pending rulemaking [2][1][19]. SB 261 has no explicit assurance requirement (risk report), but CARB checklist aligns to TCFD/IFRS S2 content expectations [22]. |
| Methodological references | Uses TCFD concepts and GHG Protocol constructs; registrants must describe the protocol/standard used for emissions [4]. | ESRS E1 references GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance and Scope 3 Standard in its application requirements; scenario analysis and 1.5°C pathways referenced; extensive cross‑cutting/general requirements (ESRS 1/2) [10][11]. | SB 253 mandates the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard; CARB may consider a “globally recognized alternative” method post‑2033 [2]. SB 261 accepts TCFD or “equivalent,” including IFRS S2 [3][22]. |
| Data quality/internal controls; digital tagging | Climate disclosures are “filed,” subject to Exchange Act Section 18 liability and DCPs; financial statement notes fall under ICFR and audit [4]. Inline XBRL tagging required [4][5]. | ESRS 1 sets qualitative characteristics and value‑chain/reporting boundary guidance; ESMA is amending ESEF RTS to require ESRS digital tagging (phased) after EFRAG delivered ESRS XBRL taxonomy [10][26][27][28]. | CARB emphasizes clarity/comparability; issued early enforcement discretion for first Scopes 1–2 cycle; further internal controls/verification details to come via regulation and market practice; CARB will set templates/filing mechanics [18][19][23]. |
| Enforcement (regulators; penalties; liability) | SEC enforcement via filing review and antifraud provisions; Item‑specific safe harbor for certain forward‑looking climate disclosures; liability attaches as filings (Section 18; Section 11 if included in registration statements). Attestation reports treated under amended Rule 436(i)(1) (limited assurance not “expertised”) [4]. | National competent authorities enforce; Member States set “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” penalties. Assurance overseen per national implementations; no EU‑wide penalty scale. Example: France included criminal sanctions for obstructing assurance appointments [12][29]. | CARB administers SB 253/SB 261. SB 253 penalties up to $500,000 per reporting year; Scope 3 safe harbor (good‑faith misstatements) and limits on Scope 3 penalties (2027–2030: non‑filing only) [2]. SB 261 penalties up to $50,000 per reporting year [3]. Early discretion notice for 2026 Scopes 1–2 [18]. |
| Legal/implementation status (stays, litigation, rulemaking) | Final rule adopted and published (Mar. 2024), but stayed by SEC pending judicial review; litigation consolidated in 8th Cir.; SEC (Mar. 27, 2025) voted to cease defending the rule; cases in abeyance; rule not effective as of Sept. 16, 2025 [6][7][8]. | CSRD in force; transposition ongoing; “stop‑the‑clock” postponements for Waves 2–3; sector/third‑country ESRS deadline moved to June 30, 2026; Commission “quick‑fix” DA (July 11, 2025) extends certain reliefs for early reporters (under scrutiny) [11][13][14][15][17]. | Statutes effective; CARB rulemaking ongoing (statutory deadline July 1, 2025 missed). Litigation (U.S. Chamber v. Randolph): PI denied Aug. 13, 2025; no injunction in place; appeal to the Ninth Circuit pending. Deadlines remain operative pending rulemaking and litigation outcomes [24]. |
| Cross-border interoperability | SEC based on TCFD/GHG Protocol; does not recognize ISSB/ESRS as alternative reporting; dual reporters must reconcile differences [4]. | EC/EFRAG/ISSB announced high climate alignment and issued interoperability guidance (ESRS–ISSB) to minimize duplication for dual reporters; equivalence decisions for third‑country frameworks not yet adopted [30][31][12]. | SB 261 accepts TCFD/IFRS S2; SB 253 allows use of other reports if they meet California requirements; ESRS E1 methods align with GHG Protocol, aiding reuse of emissions calculations across regimes [2][3][10][22]. |

## Framework-Specific Enterprise Compliance Challenges (with Examples)

- U.S. SEC Climate Rule  
  - Building disclosure controls and procedures (DCPs) and integrating climate data into ICFR for Article 14 financial statement note disclosures (e.g., 1% thresholds for severe weather effects) [4].  
  - Determining materiality for Scopes 1–2 and describing organizational/operational boundaries; reconciling GHG boundaries with GAAP consolidation [4].  
  - Assurance readiness for LAF/AF emissions: selecting standards/providers (e.g., ISAE 3000/3410; SSAE), independence, timing (limited then reasonable for LAFs) [4].  
  - Governance and audit committee oversight—ensuring board/management roles (Item 1501) and aligning calendar with 10‑K, and emissions timing accommodations (10‑Q/20‑F amendment) [4][5].  
  - Ongoing legal uncertainty under the stay complicates investment prioritization and cross‑border alignment [6][7][8].

- EU CSRD/ESRS  
  - Double‑materiality assessment at scale, documentation, and linkage to ESRS 2 governance/strategy/IRO—confirmed as a top challenge in early implementation studies [10][32].  
  - Value‑chain data (especially Scope 3) and estimation; implementing ESRS E1 data hierarchy and GHG Protocol alignment; linking with EU Taxonomy CapEx plans in transition plans [10][11][15].  
  - Assurance readiness under nascent EU limited‑assurance standards; managing national differences (statutory auditor vs IASP) and CEAOB guidance [12][24].  
  - Digital tagging (ESEF/ESRS taxonomy) integration into reporting systems, pending ESMA RTS amendment and phased tagging [26][27][28].  
  - Managing postponements (Waves 2–3) and evolving “quick‑fix”/simplification proposals across multi‑jurisdictional groups [11][13][25].

- California SB 253/SB 261  
  - Scope 3 data availability and supplier engagement at scale; reliance on estimates and primary/secondary data consistent with the GHG Protocol; planning for future assurance from 2030 [2].  
  - “Doing business” determinations and revenue definitions (gross receipts) per CA tax code; monitoring CARB’s final definitions in rulemaking; managing consolidated parent‑level reporting allowed by SB 219 [1][19][20][21].  
  - Limited market capacity for qualified GHG assurance providers as Scopes 1–2 assurance begins in 2026; organizations advised to secure providers early [19].  
  - CARB templates, submission mechanics, and fee regime pending; interim enforcement discretion for 2026 Scopes 1–2; first SB 261 reports due Jan. 1, 2026 with a CARB URL docket [18][22][23].  
  - Litigation risk (First Amendment, preemption) causing planning uncertainty, but with no injunction in place as of Sept. 16, 2025 [24].

## Cost Estimates (Government and Industry), Standardized to 2025 USD

Method notes:  
- U.S. dollar figures originally in 2024 USD (SEC) are indexed to mid‑2025 USD using CPI‑U (July 2025 vs July 2024 = 323.048/314.540 = +2.71%) [33].  
- Euro figures (EU CSRD) are shown in original EUR and converted to indicative 2025 USD using an illustrative EUR→USD factor of 1.09 based on ECB reference rates; users should update with actual 2025 annual averages when available [34].

- U.S. SEC Climate Rule (per registrant; SEC economic analysis)  
  - Governance/Strategy/Risk (Items 1501–1503): $327k first year; $183k ongoing (2024 USD) → ≈ $336k first year; ≈ $188k ongoing (2025 USD, +2.71%) [4][33].  
  - Emissions (Item 1505; only if required): $151k first year; $67k ongoing → ≈ $155k; ≈ $69k (2025 USD) [4][33].  
  - Assurance: limited ≈ $50k; reasonable ≈ $150k → ≈ $51.4k; ≈ $154k (2025 USD) [4][33].  
  - Scenario analysis (if conducted): ≈ $12k first year; ≈ $6k ongoing → ≈ $12.3k; ≈ $6.2k (2025 USD) [4][33].  
  - Targets/goals (if set): ≈ $10k first year; ≈ $5k ongoing → ≈ $10.3k; ≈ $5.1k (2025 USD) [4][33].

- EU CSRD/ESRS (EU‑wide aggregate; Commission estimates)  
  - 2021 Impact Assessment: recurring reporting costs ≈ €2.1bn/year EU‑wide (pre‑simplification assumption) → ≈ $2.29bn/year (2025 USD at 1.09) [35][34].  
  - ESRS Set 1 (as adopted): ≈ €1.7bn/year recurring (reflecting simplifications) → ≈ $1.85bn/year (2025 USD at 1.09) [36][34].  
  - 2025 simplification proposals (Commission): save ≈ €1.2bn/year on CSRD/ESRS and ≈ €4.4bn/year incl. Taxonomy → ≈ $1.31bn and ≈ $4.80bn/year (2025 USD at 1.09); subject to co‑legislator outcome [36][34].  
  - Company‑level costs vary widely by size and complexity; surveys report significant tech, training, and assurance investments (non‑official, directional) [32].

- California SB 253/SB 261 (company‑level; industry estimates; state fees)  
  - CARB fees (proposed concepts; subject to rulemaking): ~ $3,106 per SB 253 entity; ~ $1,403 per SB 261 entity annually (inflation‑indexed; per entity, including subsidiaries) [25][26].  
  - Business compliance cost ranges cited in industry/legal commentary: initial $300k–$750k; recurring $150k–$500k (depends on company size, scope, assurance) [27][28]. California Chamber has claimed initial compliance often “exceeds $1 million,” while proponents cite ERM averages of ~$533k for full climate‑risk disclosure and ~$237k for GHG accounting/disclosure for large public companies already reporting [29][30].  
  - Drivers: first‑year systems/controls build; Scope 3 supplier engagement tools/data; assurance fees for Scopes 1–2 from 2026 and potential Scope 3 from 2030; ongoing internal staffing/training [19][27][28].

Notes:  
- CSRD figures are EU‑wide aggregates; firm‑level costs depend on cohort, materiality scoping, and reliefs.  
- California cost figures are indicative and vary by footprint, data maturity, and assurance scope. State administrative fees are incremental to compliance costs and await final CARB rules.

## Strategic Implications for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs)

- Harmonized data architecture and taxonomy mapping  
  - Build a single data model anchored to GHG Protocol for emissions (needed by ESRS E1 and SB 253; SEC requires a described protocol) [4][10][2].  
  - Map disclosures to ESRS datapoints (ESRS 2 governance/strategy; E1 emissions/transition plan) and to SEC subpart 1500 items (1501–1504) to reduce duplication; leverage IFRS–EFRAG interoperability guidance to align ESRS and ISSB/TCFD content [10][31].  
  - Prepare for ESRS/XBRL digital tagging and SEC Inline XBRL tagging; select tooling that supports both ESRS and SEC taxonomies [4][26][27][28].

- Materiality and scoping strategy  
  - Apply ESRS double‑materiality for EU scope; maintain a parallel financial‑materiality lens for SEC and SB 261 risk reporting (TCFD/IFRS S2 equivalence) to ensure consistency [10][3][22].  
  - For SB 253, materiality does not apply to emissions—plan full Scopes 1–3 inventory per GHG Protocol with clear value‑chain estimation methods [2].

- Sequencing/roadmapping  
  - EU: If in Wave 1 (FY2024), use 2025 “quick‑fix” reliefs where applicable; Waves 2–3 have two‑year postponements (FY2027/FY2028) [11][13].  
  - California: Target SB 261 report by Jan. 1, 2026; stand up Scopes 1–2 processes and limited assurance for 2026; Stage Scope 3 for 2027 per CARB schedule [2][3][22].  
  - SEC: Track litigation; plan foundational controls/ICFR for Article 14 weather‑related notes (which mirror financial reporting) regardless of the broader rule’s stay [4][6][7][8].

- Integrated controls and assurance strategy  
  - Design DCPs/ICFR to cover climate data feeding SEC filings (filed) and ESRS sustainability statements (assured); for SB 253, build audit‑ready emissions processes anticipating limited assurance in 2026 and reasonable assurance in 2030 [4][12][2].  
  - Choose assurance providers with global reach and capabilities across ISAE/SSAE and national accreditation regimes (EU statutory auditor vs IASP; CARB qualifications pending) [12][24][2][19].

- Vendor/assurance provider selection  
  - Evaluate platforms that support GHG Protocol, ESRS datapoints, and XBRL tagging; ensure audit trail, versioning, and evidence capture for assurance.  
  - Secure GHG assurance providers early in California; assess capacity and independence, especially for LAFs anticipating SEC reasonable assurance (if rule proceeds) [4][19].

- Governance and disclosure controls  
  - Clarify board oversight and management roles across regimes (ESRS 2 GOV; SEC Item 1501; SB 261 TCFD alignment); integrate with audit committee agendas [4][10][3][22].  
  - Establish a “disclosure committee” spanning finance, sustainability, legal, and IT to harmonize content across annual report, EU management report, and California postings.

- Litigation/enforcement risk management  
  - SEC: Treat climate disclosures as “filed” (liability) with safe harbor only for specified forward‑looking items; manage Section 18 and potential Section 11 exposure [4].  
  - EU: National enforcement and assurance oversight will vary; ensure national transposition nuances are tracked (e.g., France sanctions) [12][29].  
  - California: Monitor Ninth Circuit appeal; use CARB enforcement discretion (2026 Scopes 1–2) to demonstrate good‑faith compliance [18][24].

### Illustrative MNE Scenario and Practical Compliance Playbook

Scenario: U.S.-listed parent (LAF) with EU subsidiaries (large undertaking) and California nexus (consolidated group >$1B revenue “doing business” in CA).

- Year 0–0.5 (now)  
  - Governance: Confirm board/audit committee oversight; formalize climate disclosure committee [4][10][3].  
  - Data: Inventory Scopes 1–3 using GHG Protocol; define boundaries and data hierarchy; gap‑assess against ESRS E1 datapoints and SB 253 expectations [2][10].  
  - Controls: Establish DCPs/ICFR for SEC Article 14 severe weather notes; document estimation processes and assumptions [4].

- Year 0.5–1 (FY2025/FY2026)  
  - EU: If Wave 1, publish ESRS‑compliant sustainability statement with applicable “quick‑fix” reliefs; otherwise, use postponement time to pilot double‑materiality, scenario analysis, and ESRS tagging [11][13][26][27][28].  
  - CA: Publish SB 261 climate‑risk report by Jan. 1, 2026 aligned to IFRS S2; submit URL to CARB; prepare Scopes 1–2 inventory with limited assurance readiness for 2026; establish supplier engagement for 2027 Scope 3 [3][22][2].  
  - SEC: Maintain readiness for potential reactivation; prepare to disclose material Scopes 1–2 (if required) with phased assurance; finalize internal protocols for transition plans/targets if used [4][5][6][7][8].

- Year 1–2 (FY2026/FY2027)  
  - EU: Implement double‑materiality fully; refine scenario analysis and ESRS E1 anticipated financial effects; engage with assurance provider under limited assurance [10][12].  
  - CA: File 2026 Scopes 1–2 with limited assurance; execute supplier data program for 2027 Scope 3; monitor CARB’s final Scope 3 schedule and verifier qualifications [2][19].  
  - SEC: If the stay lifts or a revised rule emerges, execute emissions disclosure and attestation plans for LAF cohort [4][6][7][8].

- Technology and Vendor stack  
  - Adopt a GHG/ESG platform that supports ESRS datapoints, SEC Inline XBRL tagging, ISSB S2 mappings, and CARB templates; enable auditor access for testing [26][27][31].

- Documentation  
  - Maintain a master “requirements register” mapping each disclosure element (ESRS E1 datapoints; SEC Items 1501–1506; SB 253/261 items) to responsible owners, evidence, and controls; include equivalence notes (e.g., IFRS S2 for SB 261) [3][22][31].
