# S&P 500 Consumer-Facing Corporate Rebrands (2023-01-01 to 2025-06-30)

## Scope and approach
- What counts as a “full corporate rebrand”: an official introduction of a new corporate/masterbrand logo and/or a new corporate brand tagline. Sub-brand or product-only updates are excluded unless they coincide with the corporate identity.
- Consumer-facing definition: B2C or mixed B2B/B2C. Ambiguous cases are included with a brief note.
- S&P 500 interpretation: Included companies that were either in the S&P 500 at the time of the rebrand or are current constituents; notes indicate interpretation where relevant.
- Source priority: Official corporate press releases, brand centers, press kits, and SEC filings for primary confirmation; independent design-industry coverage (e.g., UnderConsideration/Brand New) for third-party validation; credible press as backup when design-trade coverage is limited.

## Master list (qualifying companies)

### Candidates requiring additional official-source verification
The following entry appears to qualify based on independent design-industry coverage within the date window but lacks sufficient official artifacts (e.g., a clearly dated announcement or a brand-center/press-kit asset with an exposed filename) in this pass.

- Adobe Inc.
  - Status: Independent design press documents a new corporate logo/identity in May 2025 (Mother Design + in-house). Official Adobe newsroom/brand-kit URLs with dated announcement and asset filenames were not captured in this pass.
  - Independent design-industry coverage: UnderConsideration/Brand New (homepage index shows “New Logo and Identity for Adobe by Mother Design and In-house,” 2025-05-12): https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/ [15]
  - Next step: Retrieve Adobe’s brand resources (typically Adobe-hosted content-dam PDFs and logo kits) and confirm earliest official go-live/announcement date.

## Company-by-company notes

### Johnson & Johnson
- What changed: A new corporate masterbrand logo and updated visual identity system signaled a focus on Pharmaceutical and MedTech following the Kenvue consumer spin-off. Official announcement dated 2023-09-14 confirms the corporate-level change [1]. Asset package is provided for press use [4]. Independent design-industry review confirms the change [2].
- Tagline: No new corporate tagline was announced in the press release [1].

### Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company)
- What changed: The corporate identity of the legacy Kellogg Company was split, with the global snacking parent adopting the new corporate name Kellanova (with a new masterbrand logo) and the North American cereals business becoming WK Kellogg Co. Names/logos were unveiled on 2023-03-15 [6]; adoption completed on 2023-10-02 [7]. Independent validation is available via mainstream business press; design-trade coverage was limited [8].
- Tagline: No formal new corporate tagline was announced in the release [6].

### The Cigna Group
- What changed: The corporate rename to The Cigna Group with an updated parent identity and portfolio architecture (Cigna Healthcare; Evernorth Health Services) was documented in the SEC 8‑K on 2023-02-13 [9], with logo assets provided in the media center [11][12]. Business press covered the rename [10]; a PR Newswire piece framed the brand evolution [13].
- Tagline: No new corporate tagline was announced [13].

### Amazon.com, Inc.
- What changed: Independent design-industry coverage documents a new corporate/masterbrand logo and identity developed by Amazon XCM and Koto, with public reveal dated 2025-05-05 [15]. Amazon’s official press center provides the current masterbrand logo for download, although the interface does not expose the file path/filename until download [14]. No dedicated rebrand press release was located in this pass.
- Tagline: No tagline change surfaced in official materials or independent coverage [15].

## Exclusions and borderline calls
- Sub-brand/product-only refreshes were excluded (for example, beverage-brand identity changes that did not alter the corporate PepsiCo identity).
- Pure B2B corporate identity changes were excluded unless mixed B2B/B2C; examples like RTX and GE HealthCare could be added if broader inclusion is desired.
- Meta (Facebook) 2023 app-level refinements and other minor system updates without a new corporate logo/tagline were excluded under the “exclude minor visual tweaks” rule.

## Evidence confidence and gaps
- Asset filenames: J&J and The Cigna Group provide ZIPs with explicit filenames [4][12]. Amazon’s press center presents the logo for download but hides the filename until click; exact filename capture would require downloading from the interface [14]. Kellanova’s newsroom shows the new identity but does not expose a direct file asset/filename in this pass [6].
- Old logos: Where an official, filename-exposed prior asset could not be retrieved, “not available” is noted, with the best official/archival source linked for visual confirmation (e.g., AP coverage for J&J [5]; 2000 Amazon press release for historical context [17]).
- Independent design-industry coverage: Strong for J&J and Amazon via UnderConsideration/Brand New [2][15]. For Kellanova and The Cigna Group, design-trade coverage is limited; reputable business press was used [8][10].

## Recommended follow-ups
- Retrieve old-logo asset filenames via the Internet Archive (Wayback) for J&J, Kellanova/Kellogg, and Cigna.
- Surface any public, official brand-guidelines PDFs if/when companies publish them (Adobe, Amazon often host content-dam PDFs).
- For Adobe, capture the official, dated announcement/brand-resource links to move it from “candidate” to “confirmed” in the main table.
