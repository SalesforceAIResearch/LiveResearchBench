# Side-by-side evaluation of large-scale enterprise migrations to AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure (regulated-industry focus)

## How to read this report
- Three comparison tables, one per migration approach: (1) lift-and-shift/rehost, (2) re-platform, (3) full re-architecture/cloud-native.
- Each row is a dimension from the brief. Each cell lists cloud-specific facts with the exact verification URL next to each claim.
- Open-ended parameters (application types, volumes, latency, regions, timelines, budgets, RTO/RPO targets) are intentionally not assumed.

## Regulated-enterprise considerations (cross-cutting)
- Auditability and change management: Ensure centralized audit logs (AWS CloudTrail/Config; Google Cloud Audit Logs; Azure Activity Log/Azure Monitor) and immutable retention that meets regulator expectations (AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/cloudtrail/, https://aws.amazon.com/documentation-overview/config/; Google: https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit; Azure: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log).
- Segregation of duties and least privilege: Use cloud-native IAM/RBAC with policy guardrails (AWS IAM + SCPs: https://aws.amazon.com/iam/, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html; Google IAM + Organization Policy: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/overview, https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview; Azure Entra ID/RBAC + Policy: https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis, https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview, https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview).
- Key management and encryption: Align key ownership and HSM requirements (AWS KMS/CloudHSM: https://aws.amazon.com/kms/features/, https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/; Google Cloud KMS/Cloud HSM: https://cloud.google.com/kms, https://cloud.google.com/cloud-hsm; Azure Key Vault/Managed HSM: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview, https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview).
- Data residency/sovereignty: Place workloads in appropriate regions and consider sovereign offerings (AWS Regions and EU Sovereign Cloud: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html, https://aws.eu/; Google locations and Sovereign Cloud: https://cloud.google.com/about/locations, https://cloud.google.com/sovereign-cloud; Azure data residency and Cloud for Sovereignty/Azure Government: https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/data-residency, https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/industry/sovereignty/overview, https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-welcome).
- Vendor lock‑in: Prefer portable architectures (containers, open APIs) and use multi-account/project/subscription structures to mitigate exit risks (AWS EKS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html; GKE: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine; AKS: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes).
- Operational resilience: Choose DR strategies aligned to RTO/RPO and test regularly (AWS DR whitepaper: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/disaster-recovery-workloads-on-aws/introduction.html; Google DR planning: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/dr-scenarios-planning-guide; Azure DR guidance: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/reliability/disaster-recovery).
- PCI DSS and regulated frameworks: Verify in-scope services via provider compliance centers and obtain evidence (AWS Artifact/compliance: https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/, https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/; Google compliance/PCI DSS: https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance, https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/pci-dss; Azure offerings incl. PCI DSS: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss; PCI SSC standard: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

## Summary guidance
- Rehost for speed/risk reduction, then iterate: Favor lift-and-shift to establish landing zones, controls, and connectivity quickly, especially when time-bound or with complex on-prem dependencies. Use continuous replication tools to minimize downtime (AWS MGN/DRS; Google Migrate to VMs; Azure Site Recovery).
- Re-platform to capture early ops/cost benefits: Move to managed databases and containers to offload patching and gain elasticity while minimizing code changes.
- Re-architect for long-term resilience and agility: Adopt managed container/serverless patterns, event-driven integration, and multi-region designs to meet demanding resilience and regulatory expectations; implement robust governance and cost management.
