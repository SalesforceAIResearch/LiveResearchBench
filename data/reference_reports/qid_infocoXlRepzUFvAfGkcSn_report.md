# U.S. Banks (> $50B assets) With Less‑Than‑Satisfactory CRA Ratings (Evaluations Dated 2019–2024)

## Scope and Criteria
- Included: U.S. depository institutions (bank subsidiaries, not holding companies) with total consolidated assets > $50 billion whose most recent Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Public Evaluation dated between Jan 1, 2019 and Dec 31, 2024 resulted in “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.”
- Exclusions: Banks later superseded by a more recent CRA evaluation outside 2019–2024; banks whose most recent in-window evaluation was “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding.”
- Sources prioritized: OCC CRA ratings database and public evaluations; Federal Reserve CRA pages/PEs. Where applicable, reputable trade/financial media used for context and asset size verification. If a qualifying bank’s PE were available only via FDIC, it would be flagged as a potential omission (none identified).

## Findings (Qualifying Banks)
Only two large OCC‑supervised institutions met the criteria during 2019–2024: USAA Federal Savings Bank and City National Bank (Los Angeles). No large Federal Reserve‑supervised state member bank was identified with a less‑than‑satisfactory most‑recent CRA evaluation in this period.

### City National Bank (Los Angeles, CA)
- Legal bank name: City National Bank
- Overall CRA rating: Needs to Improve
- Evaluation date shown on the CRA PE: Public Disclosure March 27, 2023 (OCC document notes “Updated May 6, 2024”)
- Official CRA disclosure (OCC):
  - OCC CRA Public Evaluation (PDF): City National Bank, Charter 14695 [1]
  - OCC monthly listing for April 2024 (shows the bank and links to the PE) [2]
- Reputable media coverage:
  - City National’s announcement acknowledging the rating [3]
  - American Banker coverage contextualizing the rating and remediation timeline [4]
- >$50B asset threshold verification:
  - OCC PE states “CNB had total assets of $93.2 billion as of December 31, 2021” (within the PE’s evaluation scope) [1]
- Edge notes:
  - The OCC posted the PE in April 2024 with the public disclosure date of March 27, 2023 on the cover. No OCC‑posted CRA evaluation superseding this rating appeared through Dec 31, 2024 [1][2].

### USAA Federal Savings Bank (San Antonio, TX)
- Legal bank name: USAA Federal Savings Bank
- Overall CRA rating: Needs to Improve
- Evaluation date shown on the CRA PE: Public Disclosure in 2022 (the bank’s subsequent CRA evaluation in 2022 again resulted in “Needs to Improve”; the OCC posted the evaluation around late 2022/January 2023) [8][11]
  - Historical context: An earlier USAA FSB CRA PE—dated in 2019—was publicly released by the OCC in October 2020, also with an overall “Needs to Improve” [6][7][10]
- Official CRA disclosure (OCC):
  - OCC CRA Performance Evaluations – January 2023 (monthly page where the 2022 USAA PE was posted and linked) [11]
  - OCC CRA publication reference for the earlier 2019‑dated PE (OCC news release for October 2020) [10]
- Reputable media coverage:
  - American Banker on USAA’s CRA downgrade and OCC fine (2020) [6]
  - S&P Global Market Intelligence on USAA’s “Needs to Improve” (2020) [7]
  - American Banker reporting the subsequent 2022 “Needs to Improve” evaluation (Jan. 2023) [8]
- >$50B asset threshold verification:
  - Contemporary coverage described USAA FSB as a ~$100 billion‑asset institution when the 2019‑dated PE became public [6]
  - OCC’s 2024 cease‑and‑desist order references application of the agency’s Heightened Standards for large banks (those at or above $50B), further confirming size well above the threshold [9]
- Edge notes:
  - USAA FSB received “Needs to Improve” twice within the window (2019‑dated PE released in 2020; new PE in 2022). No OCC‑posted CRA evaluation improving the overall rating was made public before Dec 31, 2024 [8][11].

## Exclusions and Cross‑Checks
- Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was upgraded to “Outstanding” in 2020; therefore it does not qualify on the “less‑than‑satisfactory” outcome criterion for its most recent in‑window PE [12].
- Santander Bank, N.A. and other large banks (e.g., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; Bank of America, N.A.; Citibank, N.A.; U.S. Bank N.A.; PNC Bank, N.A.; Truist Bank; Huntington National Bank; Zions Bancorporation, N.A.) had “Satisfactory” or “Outstanding” most‑recent CRA ratings within 2019–2024 and are excluded. Example reference: OCC 2024 releases (Santander Outstanding) [13].
- No large Federal Reserve–supervised state member bank was identified with a “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance” most‑recent CRA rating dated 2019–2024 in the Fed’s CRA postings.
- FDIC‑supervised large banks: No qualifying cases were identified during the period. If a large FDIC‑supervised bank’s most‑recent in‑window CRA PE had been “NI” or “SN,” it would be flagged here as a potential omission because the priority sources are OCC and Federal Reserve (none surfaced).

## Notes on Dates and Sourcing
- CRA PEs display a “Public Disclosure” date on the cover that can precede public posting by months. This report uses the date shown on the PE cover where available (e.g., City National: March 27, 2023) [1]. For USAA’s 2022 evaluation, the Public Disclosure date is in late 2022; the OCC’s January 2023 monthly page provides access to the posted PE [11].
- Asset‑size verification is taken from the PE when stated (City National) or from contemporaneous OCC actions and credible media (USAA) [1][6][9].

## Summary
- City National Bank and USAA Federal Savings Bank are the only identified U.S. depository institutions with >$50B in assets whose most‑recent CRA Public Evaluations dated within 2019–2024 resulted in “Needs to Improve.”
- No qualifying cases were found among large Federal Reserve–supervised state member banks or FDIC‑supervised large banks during the period.
- Neither bank had a posted OCC CRA evaluation improving the rating before December 31, 2024.
