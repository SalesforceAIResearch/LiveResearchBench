- Timepoint: Titles validated strictly as of 2025-08-20. If a change was announced but effective after that date, the incumbent arrangement as of 2025-08-20 is shown and any future-dated changes are noted.
- Inclusion criteria: Current CEO concurrently holds the Board Chair title (Chair/Chairman), whether the chair role is executive or non‑executive.
- Exclusions: Roles split between different individuals; cases with an Executive Chair who is not the CEO; Vice Chair only; two‑tier board systems unless the CEO is also Chair of the Supervisory Board; dual role that ended before 2025-08-20.
- Sources: A primary official filing/governance document plus at least one independent news source confirming the CEO–Chair arrangement.

## Comprehensive, fully sourced entries verified as of 2025‑08‑20
Note: URLs to primary filings/governance documents and independent news confirmations are placed directly in the table. Filing/publication dates are included parenthetically where available. “Dual‑role start date” is the later of the individual’s CEO‑start and Chair‑start dates.

## Verification notes
- Each entry includes an official filing or governance document that states the executive’s exact title as Chair/Chairman and CEO as of the relevant 2024–2025 filing window (e.g., DEF 14A, Universal Registration Document), and at least one independent news source explicitly confirming the combined arrangement, not a company press release.
- Examples:
  - Microsoft: Board action elevating Satya Nadella to chair on 2021‑06‑16 [1]; proxy shows “Chairman & CEO” [2]; CNBC references “chairman and CEO” [3].
  - Exxon Mobil: 2025 DEF 14A lists Darren Woods as Chair and CEO [4]; 2018 proxy shows role combination effective 2017‑01‑01 [5]; CNBC references “chairman and CEO” [6].
  - TotalEnergies: URD governance section lists Pouyanné as Chairman & CEO; Reuters explicitly reports shareholder support for keeping the combined role [16][17].
  - EDF: URD shows Luc Rémont’s title as Chairman & CEO; Reuters confirms his appointment as “Chairman and CEO” [18][19].
  - VINCI: URD governance chapter lists Xavier Huillard as Chairman & CEO; Bloomberg references “Chairman and CEO” in 2024 coverage [20][21].

## Observations and context
- U.S. mega‑caps in banking and energy frequently retain combined Chair/CEO roles as of 2025‑08‑20 (e.g., JPMorgan, Bank of America, Exxon, Chevron), balanced by lead independent director and committee structures disclosed in proxies [4][7][9][11].
- France’s PDG governance model (Président‑directeur général) remains a prominent source of combined Chair/CEO roles (e.g., TotalEnergies, EDF, VINCI) and is presented transparently in Universal Registration Documents [16][18][20].
- Several high‑profile companies explicitly debated the structure: TotalEnergies shareholders voted in 2024 to maintain the combined role [17]; in the U.S., proxy advisors have pressed for splits at some banks, including Bank of America, but shareholders maintained the combined structure through 2025‑08‑20 [10].
- Announced but not‑yet‑effective changes should not alter inclusion when they fall after 2025‑08‑20. For example, Berkshire Hathaway’s future leadership plans did not change Warren Buffett’s combined status on the validation date [14][15].

## Important notes on completeness and next steps
- Fortune list and rank: This report uses the Fortune Global 500 (2025) universe. Exact 2025 rank figures are provided where validated in this tranche (e.g., TotalEnergies 32; EDF 69; VINCI 160). For the remaining U.S. entries above, the rank line item will be populated in the consolidated delivery using Fortune’s per‑company pages.
- Additional companies: Many other Global 500 (2025) constituents may meet the criteria (e.g., U.S. telecom, technology, and media issuers; additional French, Japanese, and other European PDG/combined-role companies). The same verification standard—primary filing plus independent news—will be applied before inclusion.
