# Sleep and Circadian Strategies for Daytime Alertness, Learning/Performance, and Mood in Adults 18–65

## Executive Summary: What works best, for whom, and how to implement it
- Highest-priority, most sustainable strategies for students and knowledge workers:
  - Optimize light timing every day: get ≥250 melanopic EDI (m‑EDI) at the eyes across the daytime (especially in the first 1–2 hours after waking), reduce to ≤10 m‑EDI for ≥3 hours before bedtime, and keep the sleep environment as dark as possible (≤1 m‑EDI). Expect small-to-moderate improvements in alertness and sleep with immediate effects on sleepiness and 1–2 weeks for circadian alignment; strong consensus thresholds exist for day/evening/night exposure [Recommendations for daytime, evening, and nighttime indoor light exposure](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Light interventions and alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Evening use of eReaders impairs sleep and next-morning alertness](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9]; [A melanopic dose–response for evening light](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14771535221078765)[10].
  - Caffeine: low–moderate doses early in the day improve vigilance and attention; adhere to ≤400 mg/day and cut off ≥9 h before bedtime for modest doses (~100 mg) and ≥13 h for ~200 mg to protect sleep. Under sleep loss, 200–300 mg doses maintain vigilance but do not normalize performance; plan recovery sleep [FDA caffeine guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [EFSA caffeine opinion](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4102)[26]; [Caffeine timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32]; [Caffeine and sleep meta-analysis with modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43]; [Caffeine during sleep loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7571542/)[33].
  - CBT‑I for chronic insomnia symptoms: first-line treatment with durable benefits for sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, efficiency, and insomnia severity; expect benefits over weeks, with maintenance over months; digital CBT‑I is effective and scalable [ACP guideline (CBT‑I first-line)](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M15-2175)[50]; [AASM 2021 guideline—behavioral treatments](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51]; [CBT‑I meta-analysis](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2841)[52]; [AHRQ comparative effectiveness report](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/insomnia-treatment/research)[53].
  - Melatonin: use as a chronobiotic for circadian shifting (Delayed Sleep–Wake Phase Disorder; shift work), not a routine hypnotic in healthy adults. Immediate-release (IR) 0.5–1 mg timed 2–4 h before DLMO (or ~6–8 h before habitual sleep onset if DLMO unknown) advances circadian phase by ~1–2 hours over 1–2 weeks when paired with bright morning light; choose USP-verified products due to labeling variability. Avoid combining with fluvoxamine; use caution with anticoagulants and seizure disorders [Melatonin as chronobiotic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2928909/)[30]; [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19]; [DSWPD RCTs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16295212/)[39]; [Fluvoxamine interaction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10668847/)[41]; [Supplement variability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263083/)[42].
  - Sleep extension: in habitual short sleepers, counseling to extend time in bed can increase TST by ~1.2 hours and is feasible; performance gains are demonstrated in performance contexts (e.g., athletics), and sleep “banking” supports resilience to sleep loss. Aim for ≥7 hours per AASM/SSR recommendations [Sleep duration recommendations for adults](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/38/6/843/2417926)[54]; [Sleep extension trial—feasibility and TST increase](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789262)[55]; [Sleep extension improves performance in athletes](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/34/7/943/2454886)[56].

- Special contexts:
  - High-stress periods (exams/deadlines): temporarily increase daytime melanopic light and use strategic, early-day caffeine (100–200 mg, observe cutoffs). Strict evening light reduction is critical to preserve sleep onset; brief planned naps plus small caffeine doses can counter sleep inertia [Light for alertness and cognition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Bright light and mental fatigue](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/bright-light-and-mental-fatigue-effects-on-alertness-vitality-per)[20]; [Caffeine under sleep loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7571542/)[33]; [Nap + caffeine to reduce sleep inertia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16453980/)[35].
  - Shift work: best-adapted protocols combine intermittent bright light during the night shift, strict morning light avoidance (dark sunglasses), consolidated daytime sleep in a dark room, timed melatonin for day sleep or circadian shifts as indicated, and early-shift caffeine only. Protocols improve adaptation and alertness in both simulated and field studies (e.g., nurses) [Intermittent bright light + morning light avoidance + dark sleep](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730403258422)[21]; [Nurses night-shift trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12003167/)[22]; [Shift RCT—timing matters](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630378/)[23]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].

## Key Concepts and Metrics
- Melanopic EDI (m‑EDI): a circadian-relevant light metric at the eye using CIE S 026:2018; approximate m‑EDI ≈ melanopic daylight efficacy ratio (DER) × vertical photopic lux. Blue-enriched daylight has high DER (~0.9–1.0), warm 2700–3000 K lighting has low DER (~0.3–0.35) [Recommendations for daytime, evening, and nighttime indoor light exposure](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Consensus exposure targets (healthy day-active adults): ≥250 m‑EDI across the day; ≤10 m‑EDI starting ≥3 h before bedtime; ≤1 m‑EDI during sleep [Recommendations for daytime, evening, and nighttime indoor light exposure](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].

## Evidence by Strategy

### 1) Smart light timing (daytime bright light; evening light minimization)
- Daytime alertness, performance, and mood:
  - Meta-analysis (29 studies, n=1,210): light interventions significantly improved subjective alertness (SMD −0.28) and objective alertness (SMD −0.34); “cooler” (higher CCT/blue-enriched) light more effective [Light interventions and alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2].
  - Systematic reviews converge: higher daytime illuminance increases subjective alertness; objective performance effects are mixed but trend positive when baseline light is low and melanopic content increases substantially [Illuminance/CCT review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28912014/)[3]; [Light and cognition 2024 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051124001042)[6].
  - Office field trials: blue-enriched office lighting improved self-reported alertness, mood, concentration, and perceived performance vs standard lighting [Blue-enriched office lighting field study](https://www.sjweh.fi/article/1268)[4]. Access to windows/daylight associated with ~46 minutes longer weekday sleep and better sleep quality [Window/daylight and sleep](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3780)[5].
- Circadian alignment:
  - Appropriately timed light produces phase advances/delays per the phase response curve (PRC) [Human PRC to bright light](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20161220/)[7]. In delayed sleep-wake phase, morning bright light plus schedule advance shifts sleep/DLMO by ~1–2 h over ~2 weeks [DSWPD trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144243/)[8].
- Evening light harms sleep and next-day alertness:
  - eReader use (~4 h before bed) suppressed melatonin, delayed DLMO, lengthened sleep latency, reduced REM, and impaired next-morning alertness vs print [Evening eReader study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9].
  - Evening melanopic dose–response modeling supports targets ≤10 m‑EDI to protect sleep latency/efficiency [Melanopic dose–response](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14771535221078765)[10].
- Light during sleep (cardiometabolic/autonomic):
  - One night of 100 lux room light during sleep raised nighttime heart rate, lowered HRV, and increased next-morning insulin resistance vs <3 lux; keep sleep environments as dark as possible [Light during sleep impairs cardiometabolic regulation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2113290119)[14].
- Safety/contraindications:
  - Common mild adverse effects: eye strain, headache, agitation; insomnia if mistimed [Light therapy adverse effects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10584776/)[15].
  - Ocular safety is generally good in healthy adults; caution with pre-existing ocular disease or photosensitizing medications [Ocular safety review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891192/)[17]; [Light therapy safety considerations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6669243/)[18].
  - Bipolar disorder: appropriately timed bright light (midday) added to mood stabilizers improved remission without excess mania [Midday bright light in bipolar depression RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969438/)[16].
  - AASM guideline endorses timed light for circadian rhythm disorders (strength varies by condition) [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].

Practical targets:
- Day: ≥250 m‑EDI (preferably via daylight); morning emphasis within 1–2 h of waking [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Evening: ≤10 m‑EDI starting ≥3 h pre-bed; use warm spectrum (2700–3000 K) and dim levels [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Night: ≤1 m‑EDI in the sleep environment [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].

Time-to-benefit:
- Alertness: during exposure (hours) [Light interventions and alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2].
- Phase realignment: ~1–2 h advances over 1–2 weeks with morning light + evening dimming [DSWPD trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144243/)[8].

### 2) Evening screen hygiene (blue-light reduction and dimming)
- Mechanism and impact:
  - Evening tablet use suppressed melatonin, delayed circadian phase, worsened sleep onset/REM, and impaired next-morning alertness vs print [Evening eReader study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9].
- Blue-blocking glasses:
  - Healthy adults: modest subjective improvements; minimal objective changes [Blue-blocking crossover trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/)[11].
  - Insomnia: small RCTs show improved sleep quality and some cognitive measures [Amber lenses in insomnia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29101797/)[12].
- Built-in blue-light filters:
  - iPhone Night Shift did not improve sleep vs normal display; abstaining from phone use before bed was better [Night Shift RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/)[13].
- Practical takeaway: reducing or abstaining from screen exposure in the last 1–2 h is more reliable than filters alone; if unavoidable, combine dimming + warmest color temperature + increased viewing distance [Evening eReader study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9]; [Night Shift RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/)[13].

### 3) Caffeine timing and dosing
- Safety ceilings and pharmacology:
  - Most healthy adults: ≤400 mg/day is generally not associated with adverse effects; single doses ≤200 mg typically safe for most adults; large variability by individual sensitivity [FDA caffeine guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [EFSA caffeine opinion](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4102)[26].
  - Half-life ~3–7 h but varies (shorter in smokers, longer with oral contraceptives, pregnancy, liver disease); peaks in 15–120 min; bioavailability ~100% [Caffeine PK review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5445139/)[27].
  - Evening caffeine can delay circadian melatonin onset (~40 min for a double-espresso equivalent taken 3 h before bedtime) [Evening caffeine delays melatonin rhythm](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac5125)[29].
- Effects on sleep and performance:
  - Sleep disruption: 400 mg taken 0, 3, or 6 h pre-bed significantly impaired sleep [Caffeine timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32]. Meta-analysis modeling suggests avoiding ~100 mg within ~9 h of bedtime and ~200 mg within ~13 h to protect sleep duration/latency/efficiency [Caffeine and sleep meta-analysis with modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43].
  - Performance: low–moderate doses (40–300 mg; ~0.5–4 mg/kg) improve vigilance/RT with diminishing returns and more side effects above ~3–6 mg/kg [Caffeine dose–response review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763416300690)[34]. During sleep loss, 200–300 mg repeated doses improve PVT and reduce lapses but do not restore baseline performance [Caffeine during sleep loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7571542/)[33].
  - Sleep architecture: caffeine reduces deep sleep, increases lighter sleep, delays REM promotion; effects scale with dose and proximity to bedtime [Caffeine and sleep architecture](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36870101/)[48].
- Withdrawal/tolerance:
  - Withdrawal (headache, fatigue, decreased alertness, depressed mood, etc.) begins 12–24 h after cessation, peaks 20–51 h, lasts 2–9 days; even ~100 mg/day can produce symptoms [Caffeine withdrawal review](https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/a-critical-review-of-caffeine-withdrawal-empirical-validation-of--5)[36].

Practical dosing/timing:
- Routine days: 50–150 mg for routine alertness; 100–200 mg before demanding cognitive blocks; keep daily total ≤400 mg, last ≥9 h before bedtime for 100 mg and ≥13 h for ~200 mg [FDA caffeine guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [Caffeine timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32]; [Modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43].
- High-stress periods/sleep loss: 100–200 mg targeted to work blocks; may repeat after 3–4 h if needed; plan recovery sleep [Caffeine during sleep loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7571542/)[33].
- Naps/sleep inertia: 100–200 mg before a 20–30 min nap can reduce post-nap grogginess and improve vigilance [Nap + caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16453980/)[35].
- Shift work: dose at shift start and early-mid shift; avoid in the last 8–12 h before planned day sleep [Shift work alertness review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994420300031)[45].

### 4) Melatonin: dose, formulation, timing, and safety
- Role: IR melatonin is a chronobiotic—shifts circadian phase with timing-dependent effects. ER/PR melatonin has small hypnotic effects in older adults; routine use as a hypnotic in younger adults is not supported by AASM for chronic insomnia [Melatonin as chronobiotic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2928909/)[30]; [AASM pharmacologic insomnia guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470)[37].
- Phase-shifting:
  - Phase response curves: maximal advances when taken before DLMO (e.g., ~2–4 h for 0.5 mg; ~5 h for 3 mg); morning dosing tends to delay phase [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38].
  - DSWPD: evening melatonin before circadian phase advances sleep onset and DLMO; effect size depends on timing relative to DLMO [DSWPD melatonin RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16295212/)[39]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].
  - Shift work: melatonin (0.5–3 mg) scheduled relative to the desired shift (advance vs delay) can aid adaptation; combine with light/dark control [Shift-work melatonin timing](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00135.2001)[40]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].
- Dosing/timing for common goals:
  - To advance (earlier): start 0.5–1 mg IR taken ~2–4 h before DLMO or ~6–8 h before habitual sleep onset if DLMO unknown; pair with bright morning light. Expect ~1–2 h advance over 1–2 weeks [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38]; [DSWPD RCTs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16295212/)[39]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].
  - To aid day sleep or delay (night work): 0.5–3 mg IR several hours before planned day sleep, combined with morning light avoidance and bright light at work start [Shift-work melatonin timing](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00135.2001)[40].
- Safety/quality:
  - Adverse effects are usually mild (somnolence, headache, dizziness, nausea) [Melatonin safety overview](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26692007/)[31].
  - Interactions: avoid with fluvoxamine (12–17× exposure increase); caution with anticoagulants and seizure disorders [Fluvoxamine interaction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10668847/)[41].
  - Product variability is common; choose USP-verified products [Supplement variability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263083/)[42].

### 5) CBT‑I: components, digital tools, timelines, adherence, and adverse effects
- Guidelines and effectiveness:
  - ACP recommends CBT‑I as initial treatment for chronic insomnia in adults [ACP guideline](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M15-2175)[50].
  - AASM 2021 guideline strongly recommends multi-component CBT‑I (stimulus control, sleep restriction, cognitive therapy, relaxation, and sleep hygiene) [AASM 2021 behavioral guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51].
  - Meta-analysis: CBT‑I produces moderate–large improvements in insomnia severity, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency, with durable effects [CBT‑I meta-analysis](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2841)[52]; [AHRQ comparative review](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/insomnia-treatment/research)[53].
- Components/tools:
  - Stimulus control (go to bed sleepy, get out of bed if unable to sleep, consistent wake time), sleep restriction/compression, cognitive therapy (address unhelpful beliefs), relaxation training, and tailored sleep hygiene [AASM 2021 behavioral guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51].
  - Digital CBT‑I (web/mobile) is effective and scalable; use when in-person therapy is unavailable [AHRQ comparative review](https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/insomnia-treatment/research)[53].
- Timelines and adherence:
  - Expect improvements over 4–8 weeks; adherence to sleep restriction and stimulus control is the main challenge; transient sleepiness can occur early in sleep restriction [AASM 2021 behavioral guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51].
- Pharmacotherapy vs melatonin:
  - AASM 2017 suggests against melatonin for chronic insomnia in adults (weak against); prioritize CBT‑I [AASM pharmacologic insomnia guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470)[37].

### 6) Sleep extension
- Recommended sleep duration: adults should regularly sleep ≥7 hours; more may be needed during intense learning/work periods [AASM/SSR consensus on adult sleep duration](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/38/6/843/2417926)[54].
- Feasibility and benefits:
  - Counseling to extend time in bed increased TST by ~1.2 hours/night over two weeks in short sleepers with additional health benefits (e.g., decreased energy intake), demonstrating feasibility in everyday life [Sleep extension RCT](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789262)[55].
  - Performance proxies: in athletic populations, sleep extension improved reaction time, mood, and performance measures; although athletes differ from knowledge workers, these data support the performance relevance of additional sleep [Athletic performance with sleep extension](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/34/7/943/2454886)[56].

## Contexts and Subgroups

### High-stress periods (exams, major deadlines)
- Daytime: increase melanopic light exposure (especially morning, but also mid-afternoon during “slump”) to boost alertness; benefits are more pronounced when mentally fatigued [Light interventions and alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Bright light under mental fatigue](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/bright-light-and-mental-fatigue-effects-on-alertness-vitality-per)[20].
- Evening: strict light reduction (≤10 m‑EDI) and minimal screens to protect sleep onset and next-day cognitive performance [Evening eReader study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9]; [Melanopic dose–response](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14771535221078765)[10].
- Caffeine: 100–200 mg doses targeted to key work blocks; avoid caffeine within last 9–13 h before intended bedtime (depending on dose) [Caffeine timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32]; [Modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43]. Short nap (20–30 min) + 100–200 mg caffeine can reduce sleep inertia [Nap + caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16453980/)[35].

### Chronotype (evening types)
- Evening chronotypes benefit from stronger morning/early-day light and stricter evening light reduction; expect ~1–2 h advance over 1–2 weeks with morning light + evening dimming; consider low-dose IR melatonin 0.5–1 mg timed 2–4 h before DLMO if needed [Human PRC to bright light](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20161220/)[7]; [DSWPD trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144243/)[8]; [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38].

### Shift workers (night/rotating)
- Best-evidence package:
  - Intermittent bright light during the night shift (e.g., several 20-min pulses each hour), strict morning light avoidance (dark sunglasses), and consolidated early daytime sleep in a dark room [Intermittent bright light + dark sleep](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730403258422)[21].
  - Real-world nurses: 4,000–6,000 lux from 01:00–05:00 + morning light attenuation improved adaptation vs room light [Nurses night-shift trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12003167/)[22].
  - Caffeine at shift start and early-mid shift; avoid in last 8–12 h before day sleep [Shift work alertness review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994420300031)[45].
  - Melatonin (0.5–3 mg IR) timed relative to desired sleep/phase can assist adaptation [Shift-work melatonin timing](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00135.2001)[40].
- Caution: If only short runs of nights, consider partial adaptation (limit night-shift light intensity/duration, keep mornings dim, maintain near-day schedule on off-days) [Shift RCT—timing matters](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630378/)[23]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].

## Implementation: step-by-step routines

### A) Standard day (target sleep 23:00–07:00)
- Morning (within 1 hour of wake): ≥30–60 min of ≥250 m‑EDI. Easiest: outdoor daylight walk; indoors: use blue-enriched (e.g., 6500 K) source positioned at eye level to achieve ≥250 m‑EDI (e.g., ~300–500 photopic lux with DER ~0.5–1.0) [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Daytime: maintain ≥250 m‑EDI at workstation; favor window proximity/blue-enriched lighting for alertness [Blue-enriched office field study](https://www.sjweh.fi/article/1268)[4]; [Window/daylight study](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.3780)[5].
- Caffeine: optional 50–150 mg late morning; if needed, 50–100 mg early afternoon; keep total ≤400 mg; stop ≥9–13 h before bedtime (dose-dependent) [FDA caffeine guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [Modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43].
- Evening (≥3 h pre-bed): reduce to ≤10 m‑EDI by dimming and using warm lights; avoid overhead bright light [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Screens: avoid last 1–2 h; if unavoidable, minimize brightness + warmest setting + increase distance; recognize filters alone are insufficient [Night Shift RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/)[13]; [Evening eReader study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9].
- Sleep environment: as dark as possible (≤1 m‑EDI); mask LEDs; use warm, very dim nightlight only if necessary [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Light during sleep—cardiometabolic](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2113290119)[14].

Minimal-viable variant (busy weeks): 15–30 min outdoor light soon after wake; early-day caffeine only (optional); set home lights to warm/dim in the final 3 h pre-bed; avoid screens in the last hour [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Caffeine timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32].

### B) High-stress study/work sprint (preserve sleep while boosting daytime function)
- Morning: 30–60 min ≥250–500 m‑EDI [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Mid-afternoon: increase melanopic exposure (move closer to window or add blue-enriched task light) for 60–120 min to counter fatigue [Light interventions and alertness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Mental fatigue + bright light](https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/bright-light-and-mental-fatigue-effects-on-alertness-vitality-per)[20].
- Caffeine: 100–200 mg start of focused block; optional 50–100 mg 3–4 h later; adhere to dose limits/cutoffs [Caffeine during sleep loss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7571542/)[33]; [Modeled cutoffs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43].
- Evening: strict ≤10 m‑EDI; if unavoidable late study, use very warm, dim, localized task lighting away from eyes [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].

### C) Realigning a delayed schedule (evening chronotype; earlier classes/work)
- Fix wake time; for 10–14 days:
  - Bright light immediately upon waking, 30–60 min ≥250–500 m‑EDI (outdoors preferred) [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [DSWPD light trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144243/)[8].
  - Evening dimming ≤10 m‑EDI starting ≥3 h pre-bed; minimize screens [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Evening eReader effects](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9].
  - Optional melatonin: IR 0.5–1 mg ~2–4 h before DLMO (or ~6–8 h before habitual sleep onset if DLMO unknown), daily at the same time [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19].

### D) Night-shift adaptation (permanent or blocks of consecutive nights)
- At work: intermittent bright light (e.g., several 20-min pulses per hour across 01:00–05:00 totaling multiple hours), target thousands of lux at the eye if feasible; combine with task-light solutions [Intermittent bright light](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730403258422)[21]; [Nurses trial 4,000–6,000 lux 01:00–05:00](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12003167/)[22].
- Commute home: very dark sunglasses to attenuate morning light [Intermittent bright light](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0748730403258422)[21].
- Daytime sleep: fixed early daytime sleep in a very dark bedroom (≤1 m‑EDI) [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1].
- Melatonin: 0.5–3 mg IR 30–60 min before planned day sleep or scheduled per desired phase (advance vs delay) [Shift-work melatonin timing](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00135.2001)[40].
- Caffeine: 100–200 mg at shift start; optional 100 mg mid-shift; avoid in last 8–12 h before sleep [Shift work alertness review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994420300031)[45].

### E) CBT‑I deployment (for insomnia symptoms impacting function)
- Use a structured CBT‑I program (in-person or validated digital):
  - Stimulus control and sleep restriction are the highest-yield components; add cognitive therapy and relaxation techniques.
  - Expect benefits within 4–8 weeks; plan for initial adherence challenges (especially sleep restriction) [AASM 2021 behavioral guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51]; [ACP guideline](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M15-2175)[50]; [CBT‑I meta-analysis](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M14-2841)[52].

## Comparative effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence (ranked for the target population)
1) Daily light timing (day bright, evening dim, dark sleep) – net benefit high; safety/feasibility high; immediate alertness benefits; essential for circadian health [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Evening eReader effects](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1418490112)[9].  
2) Caffeine (timed, moderate dosing) – net benefit high for vigilance/attention; feasible; protect sleep with strict cutoffs; individual variability large [FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [Timing RCT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3805807/)[32].  
3) CBT‑I (for insomnia) – net benefit high and durable; requires adherence; digital options help scale [ACP guideline](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M15-2175)[50]; [AASM 2021](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51].  
4) Melatonin (chronobiotic) – net benefit moderate for circadian shifting (DSWPD/shift work); safe at low doses with proper timing; use quality-controlled products [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38]; [AASM circadian guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.5100)[19]; [Supplement variability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263083/)[42].  
5) Sleep extension – feasible in short sleepers and beneficial for health/performance proxies; aim for ≥7 h and “bank sleep” before high-demand periods [Sleep duration recommendation](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/38/6/843/2417926)[54]; [Sleep extension RCT](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2789262)[55]; [Athletic performance study](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/34/7/943/2454886)[56].  
6) Blue-blocking glasses/device night modes – adjuncts; benefits modest/inconsistent in healthy adults; do not replace evening light reduction or screen abstinence [Blue-blocking crossover](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/)[11]; [Night Shift RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/)[13].

## Safety and contraindications to screen for
- Light therapy: consider ocular disease, photosensitizing drugs, and bipolar disorder (prefer midday light protocols for bipolar depression); monitor for headache/eye strain; avoid mistimed evening bright light [Ocular safety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28891192/)[17]; [Safety review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6669243/)[18]; [Bipolar midday light RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969438/)[16].
- Caffeine: anxiety, palpitations, GI upset, sleep disruption; personalize dosing; avoid within 9–13 h of bedtime depending on dose; special populations (pregnancy, cardiovascular or liver disease) require stricter limits [FDA guidance](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much)[25]; [Caffeine PK review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5445139/)[27].
- Melatonin: select USP-verified brands; avoid with fluvoxamine; caution with anticoagulants and seizure disorders; watch for next-day sedation, especially with ER/PR/higher doses [Fluvoxamine interaction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10668847/)[41]; [Supplement variability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263083/)[42]; [Safety review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26692007/)[31].
- Insomnia management: AASM suggests against routine melatonin for chronic insomnia in adults; use CBT‑I first [AASM pharmacologic insomnia guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470)[37].

## Evidence quality, limitations, and controversies
- Light timing: high consensus for m‑EDI thresholds; robust subjective alertness benefits and circadian effects; objective cognitive outcomes vary by task and baseline lighting; implementation in real-world environments requires attention to spectral content and vertical illuminance [Consensus recommendations](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001571)[1]; [Alertness meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35142669/)[2]; [Cognition review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051124001042)[6].
- Screen hygiene: blue filters/glasses alone show modest or inconsistent effects in healthy adults; strongest data support reducing evening exposure altogether [Blue-blocking crossover](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33707105/)[11]; [Night Shift RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33867308/)[13].
- Caffeine: strong evidence for vigilance benefits and sleep disruption; individual variability in pharmacokinetics and sensitivity is high, requiring personalized cutoffs [Caffeine PK review](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5445139/)[27]; [Caffeine and sleep meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079223000205)[43].
- Melatonin: consistent phase-shifting directionality with timing-dependent effects; benefits for chronic insomnia in younger adults are small; product quality variability is a practical limitation [Melatonin PRCs](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2375577/)[38]; [AASM pharmacologic insomnia guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470)[37]; [Supplement variability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5263083/)[42].
- CBT‑I: high-quality evidence and guideline consensus; adherence to behavioral components is the main real-world challenge; digital programs improve access [ACP guideline](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M15-2175)[50]; [AASM 2021 guideline](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8986)[51].
