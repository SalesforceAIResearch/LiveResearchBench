- Camera (overall): iPhone 16 Pro Max leads overall and particularly in video (DXOMARK 157; best-in-class video comments), while Galaxy S25 Ultra is competitive and strongest in long‑range zoom detail (DXOMARK 146). [3][27]  
- Battery life: Both deliver excellent endurance; across lab suites, iPhone posts extremely strong runtimes (e.g., Tom’s 17h38m; Notebookcheck Wi‑Fi 20h49m; PhoneArena browsing 22h39m), while S25 Ultra is also excellent (Tom’s 17h15m–18h35m; PhoneArena browsing 20h49m). Methodologies differ; both are long‑lasting. [11][12][9][8][31][32]  
- Charging speed: Galaxy S25 Ultra clearly charges faster (≈68–72% in 30 min; ~56–59 min to full) vs iPhone (≈46–57% in 30 min; ~1h42m–2h20m to full depending on adapter/conditions). [33][26][32][13][6][8]  
- Performance: iPhone leads in Geekbench 6 single‑core; S25 Ultra leads in multi‑core; both are top-tier in GPU with S25 Ultra posting high 3DMark WL/WLX scores and iPhone showing good WLX stability (~73%). [16][17][18][35][34][9]  
- Display: Galaxy S25 Ultra holds the lab leadership via DXOMARK Display (score 160) and combines very high windowed/HDR peaks with low reflectance; iPhone is also extremely bright and color-accurate with measured HDR/windowed peaks around 2,500–2,600 nits and excellent calibration. [28][26][24][1][9][6][8]  
- Pricing/value (Aug 2025): iPhone 16 Pro Max MSRP starts lower ($1,199 for 256 GB) than Galaxy S25 Ultra MSRP ($1,299.99), but S25 Ultra often sees substantial street discounts around $1,049–$999 on Samsung.com/Best Buy, narrowing or undercutting iPhone’s cash price in practice (promos change frequently). [1][41][42][37][21]

Important: No verified, lab-backed data for Pixel 9 Pro XL or OnePlus 13 was available in the supplied corpus. They are therefore excluded from category leadership rankings to maintain auditability.

## What to watch or verify next (to complete the 4‑phone matrix)
- Pixel 9 Pro XL: seek Google Store U.S. product/spec pages; DXOMARK camera/display; GSMArena/Notebookcheck/PhoneArena full reviews; Tom’s Guide battery tests; Geekbench/3DMark public runs; U.S. pricing snapshots (Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon sold‑by‑Google, carriers).  
- OnePlus 13: seek OnePlus U.S. product/spec pages; same lab outlets for camera, display, battery, performance; U.S. MSRP and street prices (OnePlus.com, Best Buy, Amazon sold‑by‑OnePlus, carriers).  
- Re-run pricing captures closer to your decision date; validate firmware versions in lab tests when comparing image quality.
