# 119th Congress proposals to reform 47 U.S.C. § 230 (status as of Sept. 16, 2025)

## Executive summary
- Inventory. Four introduced bills directly amend § 230 in the 119th Congress: S.69 (Schmitt), S.840 (Welch), H.R.908 (Gosar), and H.R.2889 (Online Consumer Protection Act). In addition, several Senate floor amendments would repeal or further carve out § 230 (e.g., SA 1250; SA 2240). [1][2][3][4][5][6][8][9][10][11]
- Qualification screen. None of the § 230‑amending bills identified had bipartisan sponsorship, significant media coverage in major national/tech policy outlets, or progressed beyond referral to committee as of Sept. 16, 2025. S.69 lists no cosponsors; S.840 has only Democratic cosponsors; H.R.908 has only Republican cosponsors; all remain at “referred” status on Congress.gov. [1][3][5]
- What the bills would do. The proposals cluster around: (i) narrowing Good Samaritan protections (H.R.908), (ii) adding content‑specific exceptions (S.840), (iii) recasting § 230(c)(1) as an affirmative defense and disallowing immunity after certain government communications (S.69), and (iv) clarifying that § 230 does not bar FTC enforcement or liability under a new consumer‑protection regime (H.R.2889). [2][4][6][8]
- Process obligations. Most bills do not impose ongoing transparency/reporting duties; the notable exception is S.840’s notice‑and‑takedown pathway with a private right of action tied to “false election administration information.” No bill in this set includes recurring transparency reports, risk assessments, researcher access, KYC/verification, age‑assurance, or audit obligations. [4]
- Baseline. Today, § 230(c)(1) bars treating providers/users as publishers/speakers of third‑party content; § 230(c)(2) protects good‑faith moderation, including for “otherwise objectionable” material, with enumerated content categories; § 230(e) already contains exceptions (federal criminal law, IP, sex trafficking, etc.). [12][13] The 119th proposals would narrow (c)(2), add new exceptions to (c)(1), convert (c)(1) to an affirmative defense (shifting litigation posture), and expand § 230(e) to clarify that FTC enforcement remains unaffected. [2][4][6][8]

## Methodology and qualification criteria applied
- Sources. Congress.gov bill pages and texts (including “All Info”), GPO/LII for current statutory text, and official committee pages/press releases. [1][2][3][4][5][6][8][12][13][14][15][16][17]
- Qualification definitions used:
  - Bipartisan sponsorship = at least one sponsor or cosponsor from each major party on the Congress.gov “All Info” page. None of S.69 (no cosponsors), S.840 (D‑only), or H.R.908 (R‑only) are bipartisan as of Sept. 16, 2025. [1][3][5]
  - Significant media coverage = dedicated coverage in major national outlets (e.g., NYT/WaPo/AP/Reuters/WSJ/Bloomberg/Politico/The Hill/Axios) or established tech‑policy pubs (e.g., The Verge, Wired, Techdirt, Lawfare), beyond sponsor press releases and basic link‑aggregators. For S.840/H.R.908, public materials are sponsor releases and Benton Institute headlines; no qualifying coverage identified. [14][15][16][17]
  - Progress through committee = Congress.gov “All Info/Committees” shows a hearing, markup, report, or calendar placement. Each bill shows “referred” only. [1][3][5]
- Result. As of the status date, no § 230 reform bill meets at least one of the three criteria. They are still analyzed below given the brief’s instruction to document the absence and provide sources. [1][3][5]

## Cross‑bill synthesis: 10 discrete reform approaches reflected
Frequency counts refer to the four bills (S.69, S.840, H.R.908, H.R.2889). Where relevant, Senate amendments are noted separately.

1) Convert § 230(c)(1) from categorical immunity to an affirmative defense (burden on provider/user) — present: S.69 (1/4). [2]  
2) Exception to § 230(c) if moderation follows one‑to‑one government communications that suppress “legitimate political speech” (with LE/national security carve‑outs) — present: S.69 (1/4). [2]  
3) Targeted content exception: “false election administration information” knowingly or intentionally hosted by “social media platforms” — present: S.840 (1/4). [4]  
4) Narrow Good Samaritan: remove “otherwise objectionable” and limit to “unlawful material” for removals — present: H.R.908 (1/4). [6]  
5) Safe harbor for user‑option filtering tools (provider immunity for enabling users to restrict other content) — present: H.R.908 (1/4). [6]  
6) Expand § 230(e) to clarify no effect on FTC enforcement; Act‑level carve‑out for violations of a new consumer‑protection statute — present: H.R.2889 (1/4). [8]  
7) Platform‑type scoping inside § 230 (e.g., definitions for “social media platform,” “false election administration information”) — present: S.840 (1/4). [4]  
8) Add definitions into § 230(f) to support new exceptions (e.g., “legitimate law enforcement purpose,” “national security purpose”) — present: S.69 (1/4). [2]  
9) Notice‑and‑takedown pathway specific to an exception (safe harbor after notice/removal window) — present: S.840 (1/4). [4]  
10) Sector‑wide or categorical carve‑outs via amendments: full repeal and sector‑specific exceptions (e.g., stablecoin issuers) — present in Senate amendments (not bills): SA 1250 (repeal), SA 2240 (stablecoin issuer exception). [9][10]

Note: Counting only introduced bills, each approach appears in 1 of 4 bills; across amendments, proposals expand to full repeal and finance‑sector carve‑outs. [9][10][11]

## Recurring platform obligations that appear across the bills (quantified)
- Notice‑and‑takedown for a specific content category (false election administration info): 1/4 bills (S.840). [4]
- Private right of action linked to that process: 1/4 bills (S.840). [4]
- Ongoing transparency reports: 0/4.  
- Risk assessments/audits: 0/4.  
- Complaint handling and appeals (general): 0/4 (S.840 provides a removal safe harbor after notice, not a general appeals framework). [4]  
- Researcher access: 0/4.  
- KYC/verification of sellers/users: 0/4.  
- Age gates/age assurance: 0/4.  
- Recordkeeping mandates: 0/4.  
- Design standards for recommender systems/algorithms: 0/4 (H.R.908 protects offering user‑option filtering but does not mandate it). [6]

Bottom line: Most proposals change liability contours rather than impose ongoing compliance programs.

## How these proposals would change current § 230 (plain‑English)
Baseline (current law):
- § 230(c)(1) prevents treating providers/users as the publisher/speaker of information provided by another content provider. This is the core immunity used at early stages of litigation to dismiss claims premised on third‑party content. [12]  
- § 230(c)(2) provides “Good Samaritan” protection for actions taken in good faith to restrict access to material the provider/user considers obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or “otherwise objectionable,” whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. [12]  
- § 230(e) contains exceptions (e.g., federal criminal law, IP, communications privacy, sex trafficking) and rules of construction. [12][13]

Directional changes under the bills:
- Make § 230(c)(1) an affirmative defense (S.69). Courts could no longer treat § 230(c)(1) as a categorical, threshold immunity; platforms would carry the burden to show they were not the information content provider for the specific content. This rebalances early‑stage litigation posture toward fuller factual development before dismissal. [2]
- Create a “government‑induced moderation” exception (S.69). If a platform restricts “legitimate political speech” after one‑to‑one communications from government (or those acting at its behest), § 230(c) protection would be withdrawn, subject to carve‑outs for legitimate law enforcement or national security communications. This targets platform‑government interactions rather than content type. [2]
- Narrow Good Samaritan and remove “otherwise objectionable” (H.R.908). Providers would retain immunity for restricting “unlawful material” only, increasing exposure when moderating lawful but objectionable content; however, providers would be protected when offering users tools to filter other content. [6]
- Election‑integrity carve‑out with process (S.840). “Social media platform” operators would lose § 230(c)(1) protection for intentionally/knowingly hosting “false election administration information,” with a safe‑harbor if removed after notice within the specified timeframe; candidates get a private right of action. This adds a content‑ and platform‑specific exception with defined mens rea and remedy. [4]
- Preserve FTC enforcement despite § 230 (H.R.2889). An Act‑level clause makes § 230 inapplicable to violations of the bill’s new consumer‑protection regime and adds to § 230(e) that § 230 does not limit the FTC’s enforcement of laws it administers. This channels platform exposure through regulatory enforcement rather than private § 230 litigation. [8]

Interaction with existing § 230(e) exceptions:
- S.840 and H.R.2889 effectively add to or clarify § 230(e)‑style exceptions/limitations (one content‑specific, one agency‑enforcement‑specific). [4][8]  
- H.R.908 modifies § 230(c)(2) itself rather than § 230(e), but functionally tightens when (c)(2) immunity applies. [6]  
- S.69 modifies § 230(c)(1) and adds an additional (c) limitation keyed to governmental communications; it also adds definitions to § 230(f), harmonizing interpretation. [2]

### H.R.2889 — Online Consumer Protection Act (title per Congress.gov text)
- Bill number/title: H.R.2889 (text shows “Online Consumer Protection Act”). [8]  
- Sponsor/cosponsors; bipartisan? Not ascertainable from the provided text link; the Congress.gov “All Info” page was not captured in the provided sources. [8]  
- Committee referral and latest status: Not ascertainable from the provided text link. [8]  
- Text link: Introduced text (HTML/PDF). [8]  
- Specific § 230 changes (pin cites):  
  - Sec. 5(a): “Section 230 … shall not apply to any violation of this Act” (an Act‑level carve‑out). [8]  
  - Sec. 6(a): Adds to § 230(e) a new paragraph clarifying that § 230 has “no effect on FTC enforcement” of the laws the agency administers. [8]  
- Affected platform scope: Carve‑out operates where the new Act applies; § 230(e) edit is general (FTC enforcement unaffected). [8]  
- Obligations imposed: The bill (outside § 230) creates the new consumer‑protection regime; the § 230 edits ensure immunity does not bar liability/enforcement under that regime. [8]

## Other 119th‑Congress proposals (Senate amendments affecting § 230)
- S.Amdt. 1250 to S.331 (HALT Fentanyl Act) — Repeal § 230. Status: Submitted; ordered to lie on the table. Would repeal § 230 in full and make conforming amendments across multiple statutes. [9]  
- S.Amdt. 2240 to S.1582 (GENIUS Act) — Exception for “issuers of payment stablecoin.” Status: Submitted; ordered to lie on the table. Would add a new exception removing § 230 protections for stablecoin issuers. [10]  
- S.Amdt. 2346 (to S.Amdt. 2307 on S.1582) — Additional exception language relating to stablecoins/transactions. Status: Submitted; ordered to lie on the table. [11]  

These are not standalone § 230 reform bills but demonstrate active attempts to repeal or sector‑carve § 230 via floor amendments. [9][10][11]

## Platform‑type applicability and carve‑outs
- Social media‑specific: S.840 applies only to “social media platforms” (as defined), not to all services covered by § 230 (e.g., hosting, search, marketplaces, CDNs, communications). [4]
- All “interactive computer services”: S.69 and H.R.908 apply to all providers within the § 230(f)(2) definition; H.R.2889’s edits are general to § 230(e) and an Act‑level carve‑out, not limited to one platform type. [2][6][8][12]
- Sector carve‑outs (amendments): SA 2240 targets “issuers of payment stablecoin” for exclusion from § 230 protection. [10]

## Practical implications for platform legal and compliance teams
- Litigation posture: If S.69 were enacted, expect fewer early § 230 dismissals and more discovery on whether the provider is an “information content provider” and whether any governmental communication triggered loss of protection; preservation of records of government contacts would become critical. [2]  
- Moderation standards: H.R.908 would deter reliance on the “otherwise objectionable” category; providers may face increased exposure when moderating lawful but harmful content, unless shifting to user‑controlled filtering. [6]  
- Elections workflows: S.840 would require classification, intake, and fast takedown workflows for “false election administration information” with documented notice handling to secure the safe harbor; legal should define the mens rea (“intentionally or knowingly”) thresholds. [4]  
- Regulatory exposure: H.R.2889’s § 230(e) clarification preserves FTC enforcement; providers should map potential overlaps between platform policies and the new Act’s prohibitions/remedies. [8]

## Current § 230 text (for baseline reference)
- 47 U.S.C. § 230 text (including (c)(1), (c)(2), (e), and (f) definitions). [12]  
- Title 47 codification (GPO). [13]

## Conclusion
As of Sept. 16, 2025, § 230 reform activity in the 119th Congress consists of four introduced bills and several Senate amendments. None of the bills had bipartisan sponsorship, significant mainstream/tech‑policy press coverage, or committee progress beyond referral. The bills focus on targeted exceptions (elections), narrowing Good Samaritan, altering litigation posture (affirmative defense), and clarifying FTC enforcement carve‑outs. Most proposals do not layer on recurring compliance obligations; instead, they reshape when immunity applies. Monitoring should prioritize any movement in Senate Commerce (S.69/S.840) and House Energy & Commerce (H.R.908), sponsor coalition changes, and whether sectoral carve‑outs reappear as floor amendments on moving vehicles.
