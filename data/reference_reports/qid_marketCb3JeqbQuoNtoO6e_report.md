### China—Charging scale and policy context
- EVCIPA monthly bulletins (as reported by national media) show cumulative charging infrastructure surpassing 13–16 million units in early‑to‑mid 2025 (public + private), with multi‑million public DC piles—supporting rapid truck electrification; consult EVCIPA monthly bulletins for the latest official counts (secondary reports) ([CCTV+—Jan 2025 cumulative](https://www.cctvplus.com/news/20250218/8416580.shtml))[33]. Provincial programs and NEV tax policies reinforce depot buildouts and battery swapping in freight/logistics parks (policy notices vary by province; verify latest city/provincial bulletins).

### Megawatt Charging System (MCS) readiness
- SAE issued J3271 Technical Information Report for MCS in March 2025; CharIN/NREL evaluations demonstrated hardware up to 3,000 A—enabling early corridor pilots and depot adoption ([SAE—J3271 content page](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3271/))[46]; ([OSTI—MCS Evaluation Event 4](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2367301))[47].
- EU’s HoLa pilot built initial MCS sites on the A2 corridor (Germany) to support long‑haul e‑trucks ([NOW GmbH—HoLa interim press](https://www.now-gmbh.de/en/news/pressreleases/fast-charging-for-e-trucks-interim-report-on-hola-project-published/))[53].

## 4) Total cost of ownership (TCO) considerations (regional)

### Energy prices and an illustrative U.S. Class 8 example
- Diesel (retail, tax‑included): U.S. average hovered roughly $3.5–$3.8/gal in 2024–2025; weekly time series available ([EIA—Gasoline & Diesel Fuel Update](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/))[72].
- Electricity: U.S. average commercial ~13–14 ¢/kWh; industrial ~8–9 ¢/kWh (state variation: CA commercial ~23 ¢/kWh in mid‑2025) ([EIA—Electric Power Monthly, Table 5.6.B](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_06_b))[73].
- EV‑specific tariffs reduce demand‑charge exposure and reward off‑peak charging (e.g., PG&E subscription pricing; SCE TOU‑EV‑7/8/9 with five‑year no demand charges per CPUC program) ([PG&E—EV business rates](https://www.pge.com/en/account/rate-plans/electric-vehicles.html))[60]; ([SCE—EV business rates](https://www.sce.com/business/rates/electric-car-business-rates))[61]; ([CPUC—EV rates explainer](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/infrastructure/transportation-electrification/electricity-rates-and-cost-of-fueling))[62].
- Illustrative monthly energy cost comparison (assumptions to be tailored by fleet): regional Class 8 day cab at 3,000 mi/month, 1.8 kWh/mi. If charged off‑peak at $0.12/kWh: ≈$648/month energy; at $0.23/kWh: ≈$1,242/month; add subscription (e.g., 300 kW max draw, PG&E example ≈$372/month). Diesel at 6.5 mpg and $3.70/gal ≈$1,708/month. Energy + subscription savings can be ~$700–$1,400/month under these assumptions; actuals depend on kWh/mi, TOU, and load management ([EIA—diesel](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/))[72]; ([EIA—electricity prices](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_06_b))[73]; ([PG&E—EV rates](https://www.pge.com/en/account/rate-plans/electric-vehicles.html))[60].

### Maintenance and utilization
- Regulatory impact analysis for EPA HD GHG Phase 3 and national-lab studies assume lower BEV truck maintenance vs diesel (fewer moving parts/exhaust aftertreatment); see EPA RIA for segment‑specific assumptions when modeling ([EPA—HD GHG Phase 3](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-heavy-duty))[66].
- Return‑to‑base operations (drayage, P&D, regional) enable depot charging and managed load profiles central to TCO advantage (see Joint Office depot energization resources) ([Joint Office—EVSE energization resource](https://driveelectric.gov/news/evse-resource))[55].

## 5) Competitive comparison: 2024–2025 battery-electric pickups (U.S.)

Notes: OEMs differ in what they disclose. Where model‑level U.S. sales are not published (e.g., Rivian R1T, Tesla Cybertruck), this is labeled “not disclosed,” with the OEM’s latest delivery release as reference.

### Ford F‑150 Lightning
- 2024 U.S. deliveries: 33,510 (+39% vs 2023) ([Ford—2024 U.S. sales release](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2025/01/03/fourth-quarter-full-year-sales.html))[8]; ([Ford—2023 sales](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/01/04/ford-u-s--sales-rise-7-1--to-nearly-2-million-vehicles-in-2023.html))[5].
- Production adjustments: six‑week production halt announced Oct 2024 (plant upgrades/inventory alignment) ([Reuters—Ford Lightning production pause](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-halt-production-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-trucks-six-weeks-2024-10-31/))[13].

### GM Ultium-based pickups (Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV; GMC Hummer EV pickup context)
- 2024 U.S. Silverado EV pickup deliveries: 7,428 ([GM Authority—Chevrolet Q4 2024 sales](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2025/01/usa-chevrolet-sales-numbers-figures-results-fourth-quarter-2024-q4/))[10].
- 2024 U.S. Hummer EV pickup deliveries: 13,994 ([CarFigures—Hummer EV](https://carfigures.com/us-market-brand/gmc/hummer-ev))[9].
- Sierra EV: GM has not published a Sierra EV pickup sales breakout in the cited Chevrolet/GMC summaries; treat as not disclosed in these sources ([GM Authority—Chevrolet Q4 2024 sales](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2025/01/usa-chevrolet-sales-numbers-figures-results-fourth-quarter-2024-q4/))[10]; ([CarFigures—Hummer EV](https://carfigures.com/us-market-brand/gmc/hummer-ev))[9].
- Charging/connector roadmap: industry migration to SAE J3400 (NACS) under way across major OEMs, including GM, per sector updates reflected in the SAE J3400 recommended practice adoption context ([Joint Office—SAE J3400](https://driveelectric.gov/news/j3400-recommended-practice))[75].

### Ram 1500 REV (battery-electric) program status
- Stellantis stopped development of the all‑electric Ram 1500 pickup in 2025; focus reportedly shifted to Ramcharger (PHEV). No 2024–2025 BEV deliveries are published; treat as canceled for the BEV variant ([Reuters—Stellantis stops electric Ram 1500](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-stops-development-electric-ram-1500-pickup-2025-09-12/))[14].

Notes on partnerships/specs: OEMs frequently disclose platform details, battery suppliers, and fleet software partnerships in product pages and IR decks; such specifics are not included here unless supported by the linked primary sources above. Connector transition to SAE J3400 (NACS) is referenced via the Joint Office standardization update ([Joint Office—SAE J3400](https://driveelectric.gov/news/j3400-recommended-practice))[75].

## 6) Key infrastructure/regulatory milestones shaping near‑term adoption (by region)

- United States:
  - Corridor/public charging: NEVI and CFI programs (confirm current status with FHWA/Joint Office); multiple states have energized initial NEVI sites with CCS and SAE J3400 connectors ([FHWA—NEVI fact sheet](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act/nevi_formula_program.cfm))[32]; ([Joint Office—TX NEVI site (J3400 present)](https://driveelectric.gov/news/first-nevi-station-texas))[35]; ([FHWA—CFI awards](https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/investing-america-biden-harris-administration-announces-635-million-awards-ev-charging))[37].
  - Depot readiness: CPUC’s 125‑day energization target and DOE/Joint Office energization playbooks; equipment supply improvements via transformer standards ([CPUC—energization timelines action](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-takes-action-to-support-transportation-electrification))[57]; ([DOE—transformer standards](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-finalizes-energy-efficiency-standards-distribution-transformers-protect-domestic))[58]; ([Joint Office—energization resource](https://driveelectric.gov/news/evse-resource))[55].
  - Policy tailwinds: EPA HD GHG Phase 3 and CARB ACT/ACF will lift ZEV shares in targeted fleets and segments ([EPA—HD GHG Phase 3](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-heavy-duty))[66]; ([CARB—ACT](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-trucks/advanced-clean-trucks-regulation-advisories))[67]; ([CARB—ACF](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-fleets/advanced-clean-fleets-regulation-advisories))[69].

- Europe:
  - Binding infrastructure (AFIR) and OEM CO₂ targets together accelerate supply and public charging power at freight corridors; AFIF provides capital for megawatt-class sites; early MCS pilots operational (HoLa) ([AFIR—consolidated text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1804/2025-04-14/eng))[48]; ([Council of the EU—HDV CO₂ standards](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/05/13/heavy-duty-vehicles-council-signs-off-on-stricter-co2-emission-standards/))[74]; ([EC—AFIF selections 2025](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/eu-mobilises-eu422-million-support-deployment-alternative-fuels-infrastructure-road-maritime-and-air-2025-02-06_en))[52]; ([NOW GmbH—HoLa](https://www.now-gmbh.de/en/news/pressreleases/fast-charging-for-e-trucks-interim-report-on-hola-project-published/))[53].

- China:
  - Rapid truck electrification supported by very large charging/battery‑swap ecosystems and rising NEV heavy‑duty penetration (NEV HD ≈82k in 2024; BEV dominant) with national/provincial supports (consult local notices) ([China Daily—NEV HD trucks 2024](https://govt.chinadaily.com.cn/s/202505/26/WS68341a88498eec7e1f737b66/nev-giants-fueling-shift-to-electric-heavy-trucks.html))[28]; ([CCTV+—charging infrastructure scale, Jan 2025](https://www.cctvplus.com/news/20250218/8416580.shtml))[33].

## 7) 2025 outlook and strategic implications
- Global: Continued growth in electric medium/heavy trucks led by China; Europe rising on AFIR/CO₂ standards; U.S. roughly flat to modest growth from 2024 per IEA ([IEA—GEO 2025: Trends in heavy-duty EVs](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/trends-in-heavy-duty-electric-vehicles))[3]; ([IEA—GEO 2025: Executive summary](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/executive-summary))[4].
- U.S. light-duty pickups: 2024 growth from key nameplates offset by 2025 production/mix moderation and portfolio shifts (Ram BEV canceled), implying disciplined ramps and a focus on profitable trims and fleet channels ([Reuters—Ford Lightning production pause](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-halt-production-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-trucks-six-weeks-2024-10-31/))[13]; ([Reuters—Stellantis stops electric Ram 1500](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-stops-development-electric-ram-1500-pickup-2025-09-12/))[14].
- Infrastructure: U.S. execution risk centers on interconnection/energization timelines and tariff design; EV‑specific commercial rates (subscription/TOU) and staged power strategies (ESS/PV) are critical to TCO. EU AFIR will materially expand heavy‑duty corridor charging power by decade end ([CPUC—energization timelines action](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-takes-action-to-support-transportation-electrification))[57]; ([AFIR—consolidated text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1804/2025-04-14/eng))[48].
- Technology: SAE J3271 (MCS) and J3400 (NACS) transitions underpin improved highway dwell times and broader network access for pickups and trucks; plan for mixed CCS/MCS deployments through the late‑2020s ([SAE—J3271](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3271/))[46]; ([OSTI—MCS evaluation](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2367301))[47]; ([Joint Office—J3400](https://driveelectric.gov/news/j3400-recommended-practice))[75].

## 8) Methodology, assumptions, and data gaps
- Series integrity: U.S. “sales” (Ford/GM press) and “registrations” (S&P/ICCT) are not combined. Where OEMs do not publish model splits (Rivian R1T; Tesla Cybertruck), results are labeled “not disclosed,” with OEM delivery press or third‑party registration snapshots (paywalled) referenced ([Rivian—2024 deliveries](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250103854352/en/))[11]; ([CNBC—Tesla deliveries omission](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html))[12]; ([Automotive News—S&P registrations, paywalled](https://www.autonews.com/sales/ev-pickup-boom-slowing-vehicle-registration-data-shows))[6].
- Revenue proxies: For light‑duty pickups, KBB/TrueCar price bands are used as ATP proxies (not official OEM ASPs). For Class 8, Transport Topics/Reuters price bands provide a range; actual transaction prices vary by spec/volume ([KBB—Lightning pricing](https://www.kbb.com/ford/f150-lightning/2024/))[18]; ([TrueCar—Lightning](https://www.truecar.com/overview/ford/f-150-lightning/2024/))[19]; ([Transport Topics—BEV Class 8 pricing](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/electric-truck-options))[21]; ([Reuters—Volvo e‑truck pricing](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volvo-trucks-launch-electric-truck-with-600-km-range-2024-09-03/))[20].
- Regional definitions: U.S. classes via AFDC; EU N‑categories (N1/N2/N3) used to interpret ACEA/EAFO snapshots ([AFDC weight classes](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/widgets/10380))[1]; ([EAFO—vehicle types](https://alternative-fuels-observatory.ec.europa.eu/))[25].
- China: NEV vs BEV shares clearly labeled; some national totals are available only via industry syntheses or secondary reporting that cite insurance/registration data; verify latest with CAAM/EVCIPA where accessible ([Sohu/CVWorld](https://www.sohu.com/a/752024753_100235743))[26]; ([China Daily—NEV HD 2024](https://govt.chinadaily.com.cn/s/202505/26/WS68341a88498eec7e1f737b66/nev-giants-fueling-shift-to-electric-heavy-trucks.html))[28].
- Paywalls noted: Automotive News (S&P registrations), SAE standards (J3271/J3400 technical content), various ACT Research series. The analysis uses open primary sources where possible and flags paywalled items accordingly ([Automotive News—paywalled](https://www.autonews.com/sales/ev-pickup-boom-slowing-vehicle-registration-data-shows))[6]; ([SAE—J3271](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3271/))[46].
