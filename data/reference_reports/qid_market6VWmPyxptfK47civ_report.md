# U.S. Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Analysis — Calendar Year 2024

## Definition and Scope
- EV is defined as battery electric vehicles (BEV) plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); conventional hybrids (HEV) are excluded unless explicitly noted [37]. EV share/penetration refers to EVs as a percentage of total U.S. new light‑vehicle sales unless a source specifies otherwise (e.g., “retail registrations” or “passenger vehicles”) [2][6][9].

## 1) U.S. EV Market Size, Growth, and Segmentation (2024)

### Market size (units) and penetration (share)
- BEV-only sales: 1,301,411 BEVs were sold in the U.S. in 2024; BEV share was 8.1% of total sales (up from 7.8% in 2023) [1].  
- EV (BEV+PHEV) sales: Argonne National Laboratory reports “over 1.5 million” plug-in vehicles (PEV = BEV+PHEV) sold in 2024; PEV share of annual passenger-vehicle sales was 9.9% in 2024 [2].  
- EV (BEV+PHEV) sales: The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates 1.56 million EVs (BEV+PHEV) sold in 2024 and ~10% share [3][4].  
- EV (BEV+PHEV) share — multiple sources: Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI) reports EVs at 10.2% of 2024 sales; 10.9% in Q4 2024 [6][7]. Argonne reports 9.9% (PEV) in 2024; 9.4% in 2023 [2]. ICCT cites ~10% share for 2024 [3][4].  
- Total U.S. new light-vehicle sales (denominator context): “Finished near 16.0 million” in 2024 [8].  
- Registrations (retail): EVs were 9.2% of 2024 retail registrations, indicating slightly lower penetration in retail-only data than overall sales including fleet [9].

Notes on methodology and reconciliation  
- BEV-only vs. BEV+PHEV: Kelley Blue Book/Cox Automotive (KBB/Cox) “EV” reports are BEV-only [1], while Argonne/ICCT/AAI report EV as BEV+PHEV [2][3][4][6].  
- Sales vs. registrations: KBB/Cox, Argonne, and ICCT are sales-based, while Experian reports registrations (retail), and AAI publishes both sales share and quarterly registrations [1][2][3][4][7][9].  
- Denominator differences (light duty vs passenger vehicles; retail vs total including fleet) explain small differences in reported shares [2][6][7][8][9].

### Growth vs. 2023 and historical context
- BEV-only growth: 2024 BEV sales 1,301,411 vs. 1,212,758 in 2023 (+7.3% YoY); BEV share 8.1% (2024) vs. 7.8% (2023) [1].  
- EV (BEV+PHEV) share growth: AAI 10.2% (2024) vs. 9.5% (2023) (+0.7 p.p.) [6][7]; Argonne 9.9% (2024) vs. 9.4% (2023) (+0.5 p.p.) [2].  
- 2020–2024 trend (BEV+PHEV): ICCT shows EV sales growing from ~0.3–0.4M and 2% share (2020) to 1.56M and ~10% share (2024) [4].

### Segmentation (2024)

- By powertrain (BEV vs PHEV)  
  - BEV share of PEV sales: “Over 80%” (Argonne, 2024) [5].  
  - Units: BEVs 1,301,411 (KBB/Cox, BEV-only) [1]. PHEV units implied at roughly 0.26–0.31M by combining ICCT’s total 1.56M with Argonne’s “>80% BEV” share (derived; inputs: [1][4][5]).

- By vehicle type/class (taxonomy per source)  
  - Light trucks (SUVs/crossovers, pickups, vans) represented 81% of the EV market in Q4 2024 (AAI) [6].  
  - Limitation: A comprehensive, public full‑year 2024 EV split by sedan/SUV/pickup is not centrally published; AAI’s Q4 indicator is the best public proxy for late‑year mix [6].

- By price tiers  
  - Model availability by MSRP tier (proxy for affordability, not sales mix): In 2024, ~3% of EV models were priced below $35,000; 34% between $35,000–$55,000; and 64% above $55,000 (ICCT) [3][4].  
  - Pricing context: December 2024 EV average transaction price (ATP) was $55,544; incentives averaged 14.3% of ATP in December and averaged over $6,700 per EV sale across 2024 (KBB/Cox ATP) [10].  
  - Limitation: Public, full‑year sales distribution by transaction-price tiers is not available; the ICCT model-tier distribution and KBB/Cox ATP provide credible context proxies [3][4][10].

- By buyer type (retail vs fleet/commercial)  
  - Retail: EVs accounted for 9.2% of retail registrations in 2024 (Experian) [9].  
  - Fleet context (overall market): Fleet sales were 17.3% of total new-vehicle sales in 2024 (Cox), indicating a meaningful non‑retail share in the overall market [11].  
  - Limitation: A precise EV-specific fleet share for full-year 2024 is not publicly available in the sources used; the gap between the ~10% overall EV share and 9.2% retail share implies some fleet contribution, but cannot be quantified from public data here [6][7][9][11].

- Geography (national required; selected state highlight)  
  - National: EV (BEV+PHEV) share around 10% in 2024 (AAI 10.2%; Argonne 9.9%; ICCT ~10%) [2][3][4][6].  
  - California: ZEVs (BEV+PHEV+FCEV) were 25.1% of new-vehicle sales in Q4 2024, and the state surpassed 2 million cumulative ZEVs sold in 2024 (CEC) [12]. The CEC “New ZEV Sales in California” dashboard details definitions and cadence (ZEV = BEV+PHEV+FCEV for that dashboard) [13]. GO‑Biz summarizes 2024 ZEV share at 25% and cumulative light‑duty ZEVs at 2,242,716 through Q4 2024 (state summary) [14].  
  - Other states (Q4 2024 registrations): Colorado 26.4%; California 26.2%; Washington 21.3%; District of Columbia 20.3% EV share; 13 additional states above 10% (AAI) [7].

### Revenue sizing (availability)  
- No official, comprehensive 2024 U.S. EV revenue total is published by the prioritized public sources used here; a proxy would multiply units by ATP, but public ATP is monthly (e.g., December 2024 EV ATP $55,544) and applying a single month’s ATP to annual volume would be methodologically weak and not recommended for a 2024 full‑year revenue estimate [1][10].

## 2) Key Drivers and Challenges

### Policy incentives and regulations (United States)

Federal (Section 30D new clean vehicle credit, rules applicable to 2024)
- Credit structure: Up to $7,500 per new clean vehicle, split evenly between “critical minerals” ($3,750) and “battery components” ($3,750) requirements; final regulations issued in 05/2024 [16].  
- Income caps: AGI limits of $300,000 (MFJ), $225,000 (HoH), $150,000 (Single/Other) [17].  
- MSRP caps: $80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups and $55,000 for other vehicles; classification per EPA label on FuelEconomy.gov [17].  
- Final assembly: Must be in North America; official eligible-vehicle lookup is on FuelEconomy.gov (and notes time‑of‑sale transfer capability effective 01/01/2024) [18].  
- Content thresholds: Critical minerals content 50% in 2024 (rising to 60% in 2025); battery components content 60% in 2024–2025 (rising thereafter) [19].  
- FEOC restrictions: Vehicles placed in service on/after 01/01/2024 are ineligible if any battery component is manufactured or assembled by a “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC), with critical minerals FEOC restrictions effective for vehicles placed in service on/after 01/01/2025 [20][21].  
- Point‑of‑sale transfer to dealers: Buyers can transfer the new or used credit to a registered dealer; time‑of‑sale reporting via IRS Energy Credits Online (within 3 days) [22][24]. Dealers must register to enable advance payments [23].

State incentives (selected, 2024)  
- California: The Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) is closed to new applications effective 11/08/2023; CARB provides status and outcomes pages reflecting closure and cumulative results, and a policy shift announced in 08/2023 toward income‑focused programs such as Clean Cars 4 All [25][26][27].  
- New York: The Drive Clean Rebate remained available in 2024 at point of sale, generally $500–$2,000 depending on EV range and MSRP; NYSERDA program pages list 01/01/2024–12/31/2024 eligibility and amounts [28][29].  
- Texas: The Light‑Duty Motor Vehicle Purchase or Lease Incentive Program offered up to $2,500 for eligible plug‑in or fuel‑cell vehicles; the 2023–2024 application window closed 03/22/2024; program page lists eligibility and “Currently Closed” status [30][31].

EPA standards (finalized 2024)  
- EPA finalized “Multi‑Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light‑Duty and Medium‑Duty Vehicles” on 03/20/2024 (published 04/18/2024), phasing in standards over MY 2027–2032; see EPA portal page, Federal Register text, and EPA fact sheet (EPA‑420‑F‑24‑016) [32][33][34].

### Charging infrastructure (end‑2024 status)

Public charging counts (AFDC snapshot and definitions)  
- U.S. public charging ports totaled 214,236 on 11/18/2024, including 49,321 DC fast charging ports (AFDC Station Locator snapshot; ports are the number of vehicles that can be charged simultaneously) [35][36].  
- AFDC clarifies public charging commonly uses Level 2 or DC fast charging (definitions) [37].

NEVI program deployment  
- As of the Joint Office’s Q4 2024 update, “nearly 204,000” public charging ports existed nationally, and 126 NEVI-funded charging ports were in operation across 31 stations in nine states by late‑Q4 2024; additional ports were coming online each quarter as states execute their NEVI plans [38].  
- FHWA documented first NEVI-funded stations opening (Ohio and New York) in December 2023, marking program launch [39].  
- NEVI provides $5 billion in formula funding over FY2022–FY2026; see FHWA fact sheet [40].

Network operators (U.S. selected)  
- EVgo reported approximately 4,080 stalls in operation at year-end 2024 across its public, dedicated, and eXtend networks (reported March 4, 2025) [41].  
- Limitation: Official, dated U.S.-only end‑2024 counts for Tesla Supercharger and Electrify America are not centrally published; AFDC’s Charging Networks page explains coverage/methods and is updated continuously. For U.S.-only, end‑2024 counts by network, extract a dated AFDC network-filtered dataset [42].

### Consumer adoption indicators and economics

Surveys and owner experience  
- Consideration: In Q1 2024, 45% of in‑market shoppers considered an EV (down from 51% in 2023); Skeptics cite “lack of charging stations” as top barrier and Considerers cite “price” as top barrier (Cox Automotive Path to EV Adoption 2024) [28].  
- Ownership satisfaction: Public charger availability remained the least satisfying aspect of BEV ownership; mass‑market owner satisfaction with public charging availability declined YoY (J.D. Power EVX Ownership Study, 02/2024) [43].  
- Home charging: Satisfaction improved across all three home-charging segments; home charging seen as the “ultimate convenience” (J.D. Power EVX Home Charging Study, 03/2024) [44].  
- Reliability: About 19–20% of public charging attempts failed in late‑2024, weighing on satisfaction (J.D. Power E‑Vision Intelligence, Dec 2024 and Feb 2025 editions) [45][46].

Operating costs and financing  
- Electricity price: Average U.S. residential electricity price was 17.01 cents/kWh in November 2024 (EIA Electric Power Monthly, Table 5.3) [47].  
- Gasoline price: Average U.S. regular gasoline price was $3.25/gal during 10/01–10/15/2024 (AFDC Alternative Fuel Price Report) [48].  
- Methodology for cost calculators: AFDC details energy price updates and cost assumptions used for fuel‑cost/TCO comparisons in its vehicle cost calculator [49].  
- Insurance and repair: BLS CPI sub-index series track “Motor vehicle insurance” and “Motor vehicle maintenance and repair” monthly; users can retrieve December 2024 levels for trend analysis [50].  
- Financing: The Federal Reserve/FRED series tracks the “Finance rate on new car loans at commercial banks” monthly; 2024 monthly rates can be retrieved to frame affordability headwinds [51].

### Supply chain and cost pressures

Domestic content rules and FEOC (Section 30D)  
- Applicable 2024 thresholds and FEOC rules described above require 50% critical minerals and 60% battery components content, with 2024 FEOC restrictions on battery components and 2025 FEOC restrictions on applicable critical minerals; final regulations and FAQs guide compliance [16][19][20][21].

Battery materials prices and availability  
- IEA’s 2024 market review reported sharp 2023 battery mineral price declines (lithium −75%; nickel/cobalt/graphite −30–45%) with a lower price environment “likely to continue in 2024” [52].  
- IEA’s 2025 executive summary notes lithium demand rose nearly 30% in 2024 while abundant supply put downward pressure on battery metal prices; lithium prices “fell by over 80% since 2023” (contextualizing 2024 market conditions into early 2025) [53].

Battery pack prices  
- IEA Global EV Outlook 2025 reports lithium‑ion battery pack prices fell by about 20% in 2024 globally, with roughly 30% declines in China and 10–15% in Europe and the United States, reflecting easing material costs and scale effects [54].

Regulatory cost/benefit references  
- EPA’s Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the 2027–2032 standards provides additional cost and technology pathways context for compliance scenarios and fleet transitions, including electrification trajectories under the final rule [55].

## 3) Competitive Benchmarking (Tesla, BYD, Volkswagen ID-series, Ford Mustang Mach‑E)

Scope and data caveats  
- Public, rigorously citable, end‑2024 global/regional market share, plant-level production capacity and actual 2024 output, and detailed 2024 pricing actions by region for Tesla, BYD, Volkswagen (ID‑series), and Ford Mustang Mach‑E are not contained in the public sources enumerated in this report’s research package; developing a complete and citation‑dense benchmarking requires additional primary sources such as company filings (10‑K/20‑F/annual reports), investor presentations, official press releases, configurators, and public regional registration databases (EU/ACEA; China MIIT/CAAM) that are not cited here [6][2][3][4][7][9].  
- Recommendation: Use each manufacturer’s 2024 annual report/investor update for production and pricing actions, regional registration datasets for market share (clarifying BEV‑only vs BEV+PHEV basis and sales vs registrations), and official charging/standards announcements for NACS adoption and policy responses; ensure every data point is anchored to a direct URL to the exact page or PDF.

Specific items to document when assembling this section (framework only; sources not included here)  
- Market share (global and by U.S./China/Europe), specifying BEV‑only vs BEV+PHEV and whether sales or registrations.  
- Production capacity by plant and 2024 production: Tesla (Fremont/Austin/Shanghai/Berlin), BYD (key Chinese plants), VW ID (Zwickau/Emden/Chattanooga), Ford Mustang Mach‑E (Cuautitlán).  
- 2024 pricing actions: MSRP changes, discounts/lease offers, destination fees with dates and official links.  
- Flagship line-ups with 2024 price bands and sourced specifications (official model pages).  
- Adaptations to competitive/regulatory pressures: price cuts, NACS adoption and charging partnerships, software/ADAS updates, dealer policy changes, production adjustments, export strategies, responses to EPA MY2027–2032 standards, EU CO2/anti‑subsidy investigations, U.S. tariff changes on Chinese EVs, IRA sourcing rules.  
- BYD U.S. consumer market status (2024), noting any absence of passenger EV sales versus transit/bus presence, with official BYD North America documentation.  

Note: The above items are provided as a requirements checklist. Because the present report’s source set does not include these company‑specific documents, inserting numeric values would risk uncited or mis‑cited claims; filling this section demands additional, verifiable primary links.

## 4) Methodology and Sourcing

- Prioritized primary/official sources include Argonne National Laboratory (monthly EV sales/market share), Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Get Connected quarterly), ICCT (annual market spotlight with methodological notes), Experian (retail registration share), KBB/Cox Automotive (BEV sales totals and ATPs), DOE AFDC (infrastructure counts/definitions and energy prices), IRS/Treasury (Section 30D rules/FAQs), EPA (final rule and RIA), FHWA/Joint Office (NEVI updates), EIA (electricity prices), BLS (CPI), and Federal Reserve (new‑car finance rates) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][47][48][49][50][51][32][33][34][55].  
- Sales vs registrations: Shares differ slightly by whether sources use total light‑duty sales (including fleet) or retail registrations; this report labels the basis for each figure and cites the source’s methodology page where applicable [1][2][3][4][6][7][9].  
- Time stamps: All data are labeled with the publication/update dates provided by the sources; full‑year 2024 actuals are used where available, and Q4 2024 or late‑2024 snapshots are labeled accordingly [1][2][3][4][6][7][35][38].  
- Currency: All pricing is in USD; non‑USD regional pricing and foreign-exchange conversions are not used in this report given the U.S. market focus [10].  
- Limitations: Certain segmentations (e.g., full‑year 2024 EV sales distribution by body type and by transaction-price tiers; EV-specific fleet share; detailed competitor benchmarking) are not fully published in the public sources cited here and are explicitly noted as limitations to avoid over‑interpretation [6][7][3][4][9][11].

## 5) Summary Insights

- The U.S. EV market crossed the ~10% share threshold in 2024, with roughly 1.5–1.56 million EVs (BEV+PHEV) sold and BEVs comprising over 80% of EV sales; BEV-only sales reached 1.30 million and 8.1% share [1][2][3][4][5][6].  
- Growth continued but moderated versus 2023, with BEVs up ~7% and EV share up ~0.5–0.7 percentage points depending on source and method; light trucks dominated EV body mix at ~81% in Q4 2024 [1][2][6][7].  
- Policy incentives (federal 30D with 2024 FEOC and content thresholds; selective state rebates) and charging build‑out (NEVI early deployments and >200k public ports nationally) supported adoption, yet public charging availability/reliability concerns and affordability/financing headwinds persisted across 2024 [16][19][20][21][25][28][29][30][31][35][38][45][46][47][48][51].  
- Easing battery material costs in 2024 contributed to ~20% declines in pack prices (global context), but compliance with IRA domestic content/FEOC rules and broader cost components (insurance, repair, financing) remain critical variables for 2025+ competitiveness [54][16][19][20][21][50][51].
