# Remote and Hybrid Work for Recent Graduates and Early‑Career Professionals (2023–present): United States vs Europe

## Executive Summary

- In the United States, fully remote entry‑level roles have become uncommon since 2023, while hybrid has stabilized as the dominant modality for new graduates. Across NACE employer surveys, ~48–49% of entry‑level roles are hybrid, ~43–45% in‑person, and only 6–9% fully remote, with remote trending down since 2023 [1][2]. Handshake shows remote accounted for just 4% of early‑talent full‑time postings in 2024; hybrid: 17% [3][4].
- Remote postings draw disproportionately high applicant volume (e.g., ~9% of LinkedIn U.S. postings were remote but attracted ~44% of applications in 2023), creating intense competition for early‑career seekers [5].
- Onboarding and early network formation appear weaker in remote settings without explicit interventions. Large‑scale Microsoft research shows new hires’ internal networks mature more slowly in remote/hybrid contexts; periodic co‑location helps restore “weak ties,” which are important for mentorship and mobility [10][11].
- Skill expectations for remote entry‑level roles emphasize written/asynchronous communication, project/Agile workflows, and fluency in collaboration platforms (Teams/Slack/Zoom/Jira/Confluence/Google Workspace/M365). Baseline cybersecurity/compliance literacy is increasingly cited for remote IT/support/data roles [8][9][36][37].
- Compensation and policies: Location‑adjusted pay remains common at large firms (e.g., Google), and state pay‑transparency laws in CA, NY, CO, WA, and IL (2025) make salary ranges more visible in postings, including remote/hybrid roles [26][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25].
- U.S. federal policy moved toward greater in‑person presence from 2023–2025 (OPM/OMB), making hybrid/on‑site the prevailing default for many early‑career federal roles [14][15][16][17].
- Europe: The compiled research did not include European statistical series or employer survey data specific to early‑career remote/hybrid since 2023. Several highlighted employers (e.g., Atlassian, GitLab) are global and operate flexible models in Europe, but comparable EU‑level, early‑career‑focused evidence was not available in this compilation. This is a limitation of the current evidence set.

## U.S. vs Europe: High‑Level Status (2023–present)

- United States: Hybrid dominates early‑career full‑time roles; fully remote is scarce and more competitive. Remote/hybrid remains above pre‑pandemic levels in the broader workforce: 35% of employed people did some work from home on days worked in 2023 (vs 24% in 2019), but this is not entry‑level specific [34]. Remote postings have edged down since their 2022 peak [6][7].
- Europe: Comparable, early‑career‑specific modality data were not captured in the compiled research. Employer case examples (Atlassian, GitLab) include European operations with flexible or all‑remote models, but these are not a substitute for EU‑level labor statistics or early‑career survey benchmarks.

## Availability, Pathways, Onboarding, and Early Growth

- Availability: Entry‑level remote roles are rare (NACE: 6–9%; Handshake: 4% of postings in 2024). Hybrid remains the primary pathway for new grads (~48–49% of roles) [1][2][3].
- Pathways: In‑person internships convert to full‑time at higher rates than hybrid (72% vs ~56% offer rates in 2024 cohorts), suggesting in‑person exposure still drives stronger early‑career outcomes [12]. Recruiting cycles have stretched into spring/summer (slower decisions) [13].
- Competition: Remote postings attract outsized applicant demand, increasing time‑to‑hire and lowering odds per application for early‑career candidates [5].
- Onboarding and mentorship: Remote/hybrid new hires show smaller, less diverse internal networks after six months; co‑located time helps rebuild “weak ties,” which matter for mentorship, visibility, and progression [10][11].

## Skills and Credentials for Remote vs On‑Site (Entry‑Level)

- Collaboration and async: Greater emphasis on Teams, Slack, Zoom/Meet, Jira/Confluence, Trello/Asana/Notion, Google Workspace/M365; documentation and written communication are more prominent in remote contexts [8][9].
- Project management: Basic Agile/Scrum literacy and backlog/task management appear more often in remote postings; CAPM/Scrum coursework is sometimes listed as a plus for entry‑level [9].
- Security/compliance: For remote roles handling regulated data, baseline cybersecurity awareness and certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+) can differentiate candidates [36][37].
- Self‑management: Proactive status updates, goal tracking, and structured documentation are critical in remote/hybrid for early‑career visibility and progression [10][11].

## Compensation, Promotion, Retention, and Networking

- Pay/transparency: State laws (CA, NY, CO, WA, IL in 2025) require wage ranges and often benefits in postings, including for roles that can be performed remotely or report into the state. This improves negotiation footing and market benchmarking for early‑career candidates [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25].
- Location‑adjusted pay: Many large employers adjust compensation based on duty station or employee location (e.g., Google’s hybrid/location‑anchored bands), which affects fully remote pay outside hub cities [26].
- Promotion/networking: Proximity effects can influence early visibility; structured mentorship, clear OKRs, and intentional in‑office days mitigate risk and can accelerate growth [10][11].
- Retention: NACE benchmarks indicate stable retention of recent grads; modality‑specific retention figures were not reported in the compiled sources [1][21].

## Industries, Occupations, and Employers Most Committed to Flexibility

- More flexible exemplars (global operations including U.S./Europe):
  - Atlassian: “Team Anywhere” distributed‑first with periodic in‑person gatherings; remote/hybrid entry‑level pathways in software/product [27].
  - GitLab: All‑remote with a public handbook and robust remote onboarding [28][29].
- Reverting toward on‑site/hub‑anchored hybrid:
  - Amazon: Minimum three in‑office days since 2023; reiterated emphasis on in‑person collaboration in 2025 [30][31].
  - Finance: JPMorgan moved toward five days in office in 2025; Citi maintained hybrid (~3 days on‑site) with stricter enforcement [32][33].
  - Manufacturing/healthcare: On‑site by necessity remains standard; corporate functions may offer hybrid [7].

## Policy and Regulatory Updates Affecting Remote Work and Early‑Career Hiring (U.S.)

- Federal telework: Post‑PHE (May 2023), OPM/OMB guidance shifted toward increased in‑person work. By May 2024, telework‑eligible employees performed ~60% of work at their assigned job site (and about half of federal roles are not telework‑eligible). Agencies tightened policies further in 2025, affecting early‑career roles [14][15][16][17].
- Pay transparency: CA (2023), NY (2023), CO (ongoing, with 2024 clarifications), WA (2023), and IL (2025) require pay ranges (and often benefits) in postings, including remote roles reporting into or potentially performed in those states [18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25].

## Practical Implications

For candidates:
- Expect fewer fully remote entry‑level openings and heavier competition; treat hybrid roles as the primary path to early mentorship and growth [2][3][5].
- Demonstrate tool fluency (Teams/Slack/Zoom/Jira/Confluence/Workspace/M365), documentation samples, and basic security hygiene. Consider entry‑level certifications where relevant (e.g., Security+) [9][36][37].
- Use pay‑transparency ranges to benchmark and negotiate. Understand location adjustments for remote roles [18][20][21][23][25][26].

For employers:
- If maintaining remote/hybrid, invest in structured onboarding, scheduled co‑location, mentor matching, and explicit criteria to counter proximity bias—especially for new hires [10][11].
- Align campus strategies: keep in‑person touchpoints for conversion while leveraging virtual events for reach [12][38].
- Publish clear ranges/benefits and location policies in postings to reduce friction and expand early‑talent pipelines [18][20][21][23][25][26].

## U.S.–Europe Evidence Gaps (Current Compilation)

- The present evidence set lacks Europe‑wide, early‑career‑specific statistics on remote/hybrid job availability, onboarding outcomes, skill differences, and compensation effects since 2023. Future additions should prioritize EU‑level sources (e.g., Eurostat/EU‑LFS telework modules, Eurofound surveys, ONS in the UK) with explicit entry‑level/graduate segmentation for robust U.S.–Europe comparisons.
