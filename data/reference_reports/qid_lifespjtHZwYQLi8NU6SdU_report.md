# Masters endurance runners with chronic or recurrent GI distress: causes, evidence, and a stepwise plan

## Executive summary

- GI complaints during long runs are common in runners and rise with distance, intensity, heat, and fueling stress; mechanisms cluster under “exercise‑induced gastrointestinal syndrome (EIGS),” which includes splanchnic hypoperfusion, increased epithelial permeability, motility changes, and neuroendocrine responses. Lower‑GI symptoms (urge to defecate, diarrhea, cramping) are especially frequent in runners; upper‑GI symptoms (reflux, nausea) are also prominent [1–4].
- Red flags in masters runners (≥40 y) that warrant urgent evaluation or expedited gastroenterology referral include hematochezia or melena, severe or persistent abdominal pain (especially “pain out of proportion”), syncope, fever, weight loss, iron‑deficiency anemia, nocturnal symptoms, and new bowel habit changes after age 50 [8–9,17–19].
- Best‑supported, low‑risk strategies to reduce symptoms: short pre‑race low‑FODMAP carbohydrate loading (48 h), individualized carbohydrate fueling using 2:1 glucose:fructose (60–90 g/h) practiced in training (“gut training”), maintaining drink carbohydrate ~6–8% when volume is high, avoiding overdrinking and NSAIDs, and heat/altitude acclimation as relevant [29–37,42–44,47–49].
- Pharmacologic options have targeted roles: PPIs help reflux/erosive phenotypes and may reduce occult bleeding at ultra distances; loperamide can control functional diarrhea short‑term; ondansetron did not improve ultramarathon nausea vs placebo in an RCT. Domperidone should be avoided (QT risk) and metoclopramide used cautiously in older adults. Probiotics show mixed benefits; a 4‑week multi‑strain regimen reduced in‑race symptom severity in one RCT [20–21,24–27,44–46].
- NSAIDs (especially ibuprofen) increase risk of AKI and endotoxemia during ultramarathons with no soreness benefit; avoid peri‑race use. Prefer acetaminophen within safe daily limits if analgesia is needed [47–50].

The sections below synthesize etiologies/mechanisms, literature characterization, treatments and prevention (with doses/timing), and a masters‑specific diagnostic and return‑to‑running pathway.

## 1) Etiologies and mechanisms in runners

- Exercise‑induced gastrointestinal syndrome (EIGS): An umbrella construct describing exercise‑associated disturbances in GI integrity and function driven by splanchnic hypoperfusion, epithelial injury/permeability, motility changes, and neuroendocrine responses. Symptom severity scales with duration/intensity and environmental stress (heat, hypoxia) [1–4].
  - Prevalence: “Any GI symptoms” during endurance events commonly range from ~30% to >70% depending on event and assessment; lower‑GI symptoms predominate in runners; severe symptoms are less common but frequently performance‑limiting. Symptom rates are higher during racing vs easy training and rise in the heat [2–4].
- Splanchnic hypoperfusion and increased permeability: Running, especially in heat, produces marked small‑intestinal epithelial injury (e.g., I‑FABP rises 400%+ in heat vs ~127% in temperate conditions over 2 h), with higher symptom burden and nausea correlating with core temperature [5]. Hypohydration (~3% body‑mass loss) modestly worsens GI integrity and symptoms vs euhydration during 2‑h running, though systemic endotoxin/cytokines may not differ in temperate lab settings [6].
- Hypoxia/altitude: Exercise in hypoxia (simulated 3,500–4,000 m) increases intestinal injury markers and inflammatory responses, which may worsen GI tolerance at altitude until adapted [7].
- Ischemic colitis/enteropathy: Acute, post‑exercise cramping abdominal pain with hematochezia is the classic pattern. Most cases are transient and self‑limited; severe disease can occur. Risk modifiers include dehydration and NSAID use [8]. Occult and overt GI bleeding after marathons/ultras is described (e.g., post‑race fecal occult blood test positivity up to ~20% in some series; visible blood reported in a minority) [4].
- GERD/gastritis/ulcer disease: Running can increase reflux via decreased LES tone, increased abdominal pressure, and transient LES relaxations; erosive gastritis/ulceration may bleed after extreme endurance efforts in susceptible athletes [11–12,21].
- Functional GI disorders (DGBI) such as IBS: Common in the general population and in athletes; a positive diagnostic strategy is recommended. IBS‑D symptoms can be amplified by exercise‑specific stressors (e.g., hyperosmolar fueling, heat) [9–10].
- Food intolerances/malabsorption: FODMAPs (lactose, fructose, polyols, fructans, galacto‑oligosaccharides) provoke symptoms in sensitive athletes; simple sugars without co‑transport (e.g., high fructose without glucose) can worsen malabsorption at higher intakes [29–31,35].
- Hydration/electrolyte disturbances: Overdrinking increases risk of exercise‑associated hyponatremia (EAH) with neurologic danger; the primary prevention is avoiding weight gain during events. Sodium can support fluid balance for salty sweaters in very prolonged events but does not prevent EAH if overdrinking occurs [37–38,55–56]. Hypohydration/heat intensify epithelial injury and GI symptoms [5–6].
- Microbiome‑related factors: Endurance events can produce endotoxemia and inflammatory cytokine rises; probiotic interventions show mixed, strain‑specific effects on symptoms (see Treatments) [44–46,48–49].
- Medication‑related factors:
  - NSAIDs increase risk of AKI and gut injury/endotoxemia during ultramarathons without soreness benefit; they are also risk factors for ulcer disease and possibly ischemic colitis in susceptible athletes [47–50,8].
  - PPIs/H2RAs reduce acid exposure (utility in reflux/erosive disease). Ranitidine has been withdrawn (NDMA impurities); famotidine is the current H2RA option if needed [21–23].
  - SSRIs and PPIs are associated with microscopic colitis risk, especially in older women with chronic watery diarrhea; diagnose with colonic biopsies when suspected [16].

Key risk modifiers: longer duration and intensity, heat, hypohydration, altitude/hypoxia, high‑osmolar fueling, unpracticed products or high late‑race boluses, high fiber/fat pre‑run, large caffeine boluses in sensitive athletes, and NSAID exposure [1–7,31,35,37–38].

## 2) How similar cases are described in the literature

- Symptom clusters: Lower‑GI complaints (urge to defecate, diarrhea, cramping) dominate in runners; upper‑GI (nausea, reflux, belching) also common. Running imposes greater mechanical jostling than cycling; heat and intensity amplify symptoms across modalities [2–4].
- Exercise‑induced ischemic colitis (IC): Presents with cramping lower abdominal pain followed within hours by hematochezia; typically self‑limited with supportive care. ACG colon ischemia guideline details evaluation/severity; defer full insufflation acutely; colonoscopy weeks later to exclude strictures or malignancy. NSAIDs and dehydration may increase risk. Case reports include recurrent IC in a 41‑year‑old runner improving with hydration optimization and low‑dose sildenafil ± fludrocortisone under specialist care [8,57].
- Occult/overt bleeding after endurance events: Post‑race FOBT positivity and occasional overt blood reported after marathons/ultras; pantoprazole prophylaxis reduced occult bleeding in a 246‑km ultramarathon RCT [4,20].
- Red‑flag features requiring urgent work‑up:
  - Hematochezia/melena; severe persistent/worsening abdominal pain (especially “pain out of proportion” → consider acute mesenteric ischemia; obtain urgent CTA); syncope/presyncope; fever; tachycardia/hypotension; iron‑deficiency anemia; unintentional weight loss; nocturnal symptoms; new bowel habit changes ≥50 y; family history of IBD/CRC; inadequate CRC screening [8–9,17–19].
- Diagnostic criteria and approaches used:
  - IBS/DGBI: ACG recommends a positive diagnostic strategy; fecal calprotectin (±CRP) to exclude IBD in chronic diarrhea presentations; avoid routine broad stool pathogen testing without risk factors [9–10].
  - Dyspepsia/ulcer disease: Noninvasive H. pylori testing with test‑and‑treat if <60 y without alarms; endoscopy for ≥60 y or alarm features [11–12].
  - Microscopic colitis: Chronic watery diarrhea, especially in older women; normal colonoscopy appearance; diagnosis requires random biopsies; treat with budesonide [16].
  - Lower GI bleeding: ESGE guideline for acute lower GI bleeding—risk triage, imaging, and colonoscopy timing [18].

## 3) Treatments: comparative effectiveness and safety

Evidence strength key (approximate):
- High: multiple RCTs and/or systematic reviews with consistent results.
- Moderate: ≥1 RCT or well‑designed crossover/cohort; or consistent older trials.
- Low: pilot/case series/expert consensus or indirect populations.

Pharmacologic

- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (moderate):
  - Pantoprazole 20 mg daily started 3 days pre‑race reduced occult GI bleeding after a 246‑km ultramarathon (2/20 vs 12/17 positive FOBT; RD ≈ −0.86; no serious AEs reported) [20].
  - Omeprazole 20 mg daily for 6–7 days reduced esophageal acid exposure during treadmill running in symptomatic competitive runners but did not significantly reduce reported symptoms (small RCT, n=14) [21].
  - Use for clear reflux/erosive phenotypes or prior bleeding; limit long‑term use to guideline indications [11–12].
- H2 receptor antagonists (low–moderate): Ranitidine reduced acid exposure in older studies but is off market due to NDMA impurities; if an H2RA is preferred, famotidine is the available class alternative (no endurance‑specific trials) [22–23].
- Antidiarrheals (moderate):
  - Loperamide: effective for short‑term control of loose stools (traveler’s diarrhea guidelines); race‑day use reasonable when non‑inflammatory functional diarrhea/urgency predominates. Dosing: 4 mg once, then 2 mg after each loose stool (max 16 mg/day). Avoid with suspected ischemia/dysentery (fever, blood) [24].
  - Bismuth subsalicylate: reduces stool frequency/urgency in TD; consider for pre‑race travel. Salicylate cautions apply [24].
- Antiemetics (moderate):
  - Ondansetron 4 mg capsules during 55–160 km ultras did not reduce nausea/vomiting vs placebo (TOO FUN RCT). ODT may act faster but untested in this context; monitor for constipation/QT [25].
  - Domperidone: not FDA‑approved; QT/arrhythmia risks increase with age (>60 y) and higher doses—avoid [26].
  - Metoclopramide: prokinetic antiemetic; neurologic adverse effect risks are higher in older adults—reserve for select cases under clinician oversight [27].
- Antibiotics for specific diagnoses (moderate–high, condition‑dependent):
  - Rifaximin for IBS‑D: meta‑analyses show modest benefits in global symptoms/bloating after 10–14 day courses; effects last weeks–months; recurrences common; generally safe [28].
  - Traveler’s diarrhea: azithromycin, rifaximin/rifamycin SV, or fluoroquinolones as indicated; loperamide adjunct. Prophylaxis generally not advised [24].
  - H. pylori infection: treat per 2024 ACG (optimized 14‑day bismuth quadruple therapy first‑line; alternatives include rifabutin triple or vonoprazan‑amoxicillin); verify eradication [12].
- Antispasmodics (low): Hyoscine butylbromide/dicyclomine lack endurance RCTs; anticholinergic effects can slow gastric emptying and impair heat dissipation—use sparingly for colicky pain, avoid in heat [58].

Diet and nutrition outside the race

- Low‑FODMAP (moderate): Short‑term low‑FODMAP diet (3–6 days) reduced daily and exercise‑related GI symptoms and improved perceived exercise capacity in athletes with GI complaints; individualized reintroduction is essential to avoid long‑term restriction risks [29].
- 48‑hour high‑carbohydrate low‑FODMAP preload (moderate): ~10–12 g/kg/day carbohydrate with ~3 g/day FODMAP for 48 h pre‑event reduced GI symptoms during a 2 h steady run + 1 h test in endurance athletes (crossover RCT; mean age ~42 y) [30].
- Fiber manipulation (low–moderate): Reducing insoluble fiber 24–48 h pre‑race is common and associated with fewer lower‑GI symptoms; controlled trials are limited; favor low‑residue, low‑FODMAP carb sources in the final 1–2 days [31].
- Lactose/fructose management (moderate): History or hydrogen/methane breath testing can identify malabsorption; LFOD trials frequently reveal triggers [15,29–31].
- Gluten‑free diet (moderate): No benefit for non‑celiac endurance athletes on GI symptoms or performance; reserve strict gluten avoidance for biopsy‑proven celiac disease [32].

Fueling during exercise

- Carbohydrate type/amount (high for multiple transportable carbohydrates; moderate for hydrogel in running):
  - Glucose+fructose mixtures improve exogenous carbohydrate oxidation and tolerance at higher intakes; in a running RCT, a 2:1 glucose:fructose hydrogel at 90 g/h improved a 5‑km time trial after prolonged running by ~2.1% vs a standard drink and produced fewer GI symptoms vs the standard drink (not vs placebo) [33].
  - Practical target: 60–90 g/h for marathons/ultras using 2:1 glucose:fructose; some tolerate >90 g/h with training [31,33,42–43].
- Format and osmolality (moderate):
  - Hypertonic/high‑energy density solutions (>7–8% carbohydrate) slow gastric emptying and increase upper‑GI complaints; keep drink carbohydrate ~6–8% when large volumes are needed; pair gels with sufficient water [35].
  - Gels vs drinks: limited direct running data; some triathlon data report more GI discomfort with gels vs matched drinks at ~68 g/h without performance difference—individualize [34].
- Caffeine (high for performance; moderate for GI tolerability):
  - Average endurance running performance gain is small but significant (~0.7% faster time trials; 3–9 mg/kg effective). Start with 1–3 mg/kg 60 min pre‑run in masters; consider split dosing in ultras. Gums/lozenges act in 10–20 min [39–40].
  - Caffeinated carbohydrate‑electrolyte drink did not increase overall GI complaints vs non‑caffeinated in an 18‑km field run; individual sensitivity varies [41].

Hydration and sodium

- Drink‑to‑thirst vs programmed (moderate): In a treadmill half‑marathon at 30 °C, programmed drinking to limit body‑mass loss (<2%) offered no performance benefit over thirst‑driven intake, despite slightly lower core temperature/HR [36].
- Hyponatremia prevention (high): Primary prevention is to avoid overdrinking (especially weight gain during events). Sodium intake can aid palatability/retention and replace losses for salty sweaters in long, hot events, but it does not prevent EAH if overdrinking persists [37–38,55–56].
- Typical sports drink sodium concentrations (moderate): ~10–30 mmol/L (230–690 mg/L); tailor to sweat sodium loss and taste [55].

Gut training (moderate)

- Two‑week protocols pairing regular running with progressive intake to the race target (e.g., 90 g/h 2:1 glucose:fructose) reduced upper/lower GI symptoms, lowered breath H2 (less malabsorption), and improved performance distance vs control in runners [42].
- In elite race walkers/runners pushing ≥90 g/h with high‑CHO diets and gut training, benefits on epithelial injury/performance were variable—meeting guideline targets and practicing seems sufficient for most [43].

Probiotics/prebiotics (moderate; heterogeneous)

- A 28‑day multi‑strain Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium (25 billion CFU/day) reduced symptom severity (especially late race) and attenuated late‑race slowing in recreational marathoners (finish time unchanged) [44].
- Systematic reviews show slight evidence that probiotics reduce GI symptoms in athletes; heterogeneity in strains/doses is high; several single‑strain trials are negative [45–46].
- Avoid adding high‑FODMAP prebiotics (e.g., inulin) close to events in sensitive athletes [29,31].

NSAID avoidance/analgesia

- Ibuprofen 400 mg q4h during 80 km ultramarathons increased AKI incidence vs placebo (52% vs 34%; NNH ≈ 5.5) [47]; Western States data link ibuprofen to higher endotoxemia and cytokines with no soreness benefit [48]. Even short laboratory runs show inflammatory signaling changes with ibuprofen; GI/renal risk rises with duration/heat [49–50].
- Prefer non‑NSAID strategies; acetaminophen can be considered within safe daily limits in the absence of liver disease (ergogenic data mainly in cycling).

Heat and altitude management (moderate–high)

- Heat exacerbates epithelial injury and symptoms; nausea tracks core temperature. Heat acclimation improves thermoregulation; pre‑cooling/ice slushies (4–8 g/kg pre‑start, 1–2 g/kg every 15–20 min as feasible) lower body temperature and can aid performance; GI‑specific injury effects are mixed [5,51].
- At altitude, reduce initial carbohydrate rate and bolus size; increase spacing; practice fueling at target altitude if possible [7].

## 4) Prevention playbook: fueling, hydration, caffeine, and training

Practical implementation (train well before race day):

- 48‑hour preload (moderate): Combine carbohydrate loading with low‑FODMAP choices for 48 h pre‑race (≈10–12 g/kg/day carbohydrate; ≈3 g/day FODMAP). Choose low‑residue staples (e.g., white rice, rice cakes, white bread, low‑FODMAP sports products) [30–31].
- Pre‑run meal: Last solid meal 3–4 h pre‑start; avoid very high fiber/fat or large protein loads; a small low‑fiber carbohydrate snack 60–90 min pre‑start only if practiced/tolerated [31].
- During‑run carbohydrate: Progressively train to 60–90 g/h of 2:1 glucose:fructose. Keep drink carbohydrate ~6–8% when drinking large volumes; if using gels/chews, co‑ingest sufficient water; consider hydrogel formulations if standard drinks cause symptoms [33,35,42–43].
- Fluids/sodium: Drink to thirst guided by training weigh‑ins; avoid weight gain; in long/hot events for salty sweaters, consider ~300–600 mg sodium/hour via drink/foods/capsules (adjusted to taste/sweat rate); remember sodium cannot prevent EAH if overdrinking continues [36–38,55–56].
- Caffeine: Start conservatively in masters (1–3 mg/kg ~60 min pre‑start), with optional 1–2 mg/kg mid‑race in ultras; avoid very large boluses; beware reflux/urgency triggers; gums/lozenges act faster if needed late in events [39–41].
- Heat/altitude: Heat acclimate over 10–14 days when possible; use pre‑cooling and ice slushies in hot races; at altitude, initially reduce intake rate/bolus size and practice fueling at elevation [5,7,51].
- Gut training: Include 2–3 “gut‑challenge” sessions/week for ≥2 weeks in the final build—run at race‑like intensity while consuming target carbohydrate and fluids using the same products and spacing you will race with [42–43].
- Medication hygiene: Avoid pre‑event NSAIDs and aspirin; if needed, consider acetaminophen within safe limits; review chronic PPI/SSRI need in older women with watery diarrhea (microscopic colitis evaluation if indicated) [16,47–50].

## 5) Diagnostic approach tailored to masters runners (≥40 y)

A. Screen for red flags and triage
- Immediate/urgent evaluation if: hematochezia/melena, severe persistent or “out‑of‑proportion” abdominal pain (consider acute mesenteric ischemia → urgent CTA), syncope, fever, tachycardia/hypotension, or substantial ongoing bleeding. In suspected ischemic colitis, resuscitate, obtain labs (CBC, CMP, CRP, lactate), CT abdomen/pelvis; colonoscopy is often deferred acutely and scheduled weeks later after healing to exclude stricture/neoplasia [8,17–18].

B. Focused history for runners
- Timing/context: during vs after runs; race vs training; distance, intensity, heat/altitude
- Nutrition: last pre‑run meal timing, fiber/fat, habitual FODMAPs; in‑run carbohydrate grams/hour, fructose:glucose mix, product osmolality/format; caffeine dose/timing
- Hydration: drink strategy; pre/post weights; sodium sources
- Medications/supplements: NSAIDs/aspirin, PPIs/SSRIs, iron, magnesium, sugar alcohols, herbs
- Baseline GI history: GERD, ulcers, IBS, IBD, celiac; bowel habit patterns; nocturnal symptoms; weight loss; anemia
- Travel/infections/antibiotics; menstrual status; family history IBD/CRC [9–12,31]

C. Physical exam
- Vitals including orthostasis; hydration status; abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs; rectal exam if bleeding reported [18,21].

D. First‑line tests (outpatient, non‑urgent)
- CBC (anemia), ferritin/iron studies; CMP; CRP
- Fecal calprotectin (or lactoferrin) to exclude IBD in chronic diarrhea presentations (especially IBS‑D phenotype) [9–10]
- Targeted stool tests: Giardia antigen/PCR if risk (travel, camping, known outbreaks); avoid routine broad stool panels without epidemiologic indications [10]

E. Serologies and specific testing
- Celiac panel (tTG‑IgA with total IgA; IgG‑based if IgA deficient). Positive screens → duodenal biopsy while on gluten [13]
- H. pylori noninvasive test (urea breath test or fecal antigen; hold PPIs ≥2 weeks) for dyspepsia/ulcer symptoms; treat per 2024 ACG and confirm eradication [11–12]
- Suspected SIBO: selective hydrogen/methane breath testing in symptomatic patients with risk factors (prior luminal surgery, motility disorders) or refractory IBS; treat confirmed cases [14]
- Carbohydrate malabsorption breath tests (lactose 25 g; fructose 20–25 g) with symptom tracking in selected cases; interpret with caution and clinical context [15]
- Bile acid diarrhea: where SeHCAT is unavailable (USA), consider fasting serum C4/FGF19 if accessible or a therapeutic trial of a bile acid sequestrant in high suspicion; testing is preferred when feasible [52]

F. Imaging/endoscopy
- Suspected ischemic colitis: CT for diagnosis; colonoscopy typically deferred acutely and performed weeks later post‑recovery [8]
- Acute mesenteric ischemia: urgent CTA without delay for severe “pain out of proportion” [17]
- Dyspepsia ≥60 y or alarm features: endoscopy per guidelines [11]
- Chronic watery diarrhea in older women: colonoscopy with random biopsies to rule out microscopic colitis [16]

G. Referral to gastroenterology
- Any red flags; abnormal fecal calprotectin; persistent iron‑deficiency anemia; positive celiac serology; suspected bile acid diarrhea or SIBO requiring advanced testing; persistent IBS‑like symptoms despite guideline‑directed care; suspected ischemic colitis, IBD, peptic ulcer disease, or biliary/pancreatic disease; need for endoscopy/colonoscopy [8–12,16,18].

H. Return‑to‑running (RTR)
- Ischemic colitis (mild–moderate): Rest, rehydration, bowel rest as needed; avoid NSAIDs/vasoconstrictors; most recover in days. RTR when symptom‑free, hydrated, labs normalizing, and no ongoing bleeding; gradual progression over 1–3+ weeks with attention to hydration, fueling osmolality, and heat. Severe/recurrent cases require delayed RTR and GI clearance; case reports describe selected use of vasodilators under specialist care [8,57].
- Peptic ulcer/upper GI bleeding: Stabilize and treat per ACG UGIB guideline; RTR after hemostasis and clinical stability with staged return; avoid NSAIDs going forward [21].
- After uncomplicated sedated endoscopy/colonoscopy: avoid strenuous exercise for ~24 h; follow endoscopist’s instructions if polypectomy/biopsies performed [53].
- Infectious gastroenteritis: no training during active illness; generally wait 48 h after last vomiting/diarrhea before graded return [54].
- EIGS/IBS‑like without organic disease: graded exposure; integrate LFOD preload, individualized fueling/hydration, gut training, and heat management; reassess and escalate care if symptoms persist [29–31,36,42].

## 6) What works best (ranked by evidence strength and benefit–risk for masters runners)

High
- Multiple transportable carbohydrates (2:1 glucose:fructose) practiced in training; 60–90 g/h, with drink CHO ~6–8% when volume is high [31,33,35,42–43].
- Caffeine for performance (individualize dose/timing; monitor GI tolerance; start low in masters) [39–41].
- Avoid overdrinking; prevent EAH by not gaining weight during events; use individualized thirst‑guided plans [36–38,55–56].
- NSAID avoidance around training/racing; risk of AKI/endotoxemia without soreness benefit [47–50].

Moderate
- 48‑h high‑carbohydrate low‑FODMAP preload; short‑term low‑FODMAP trial with reintroduction [29–31].
- Two‑week gut‑training protocols to increase carbohydrate tolerance and reduce symptoms [42].
- Hydrogel carbohydrate (2:1) at high intake (90 g/h) if standard solutions cause symptoms [33].
- Probiotics: consider a 4‑week multi‑strain Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium course in recurrent sufferers; expect small, strain‑specific benefits [44–46].
- PPI for reflux/erosive disease phenotypes; consider pre‑ultra pantoprazole in those with prior occult bleeding [20–21].
- Heat acclimation and pre‑cooling/ice slushies in hot conditions [5,51].

Low–Moderate
- Fiber reduction 24–48 h pre‑race; low‑residue choices [31].
- Format tweaks (gels vs drinks/chews) based on individual tolerance; pair gels with water [34–35].
- Antidiarrheals (loperamide/bismuth) for functional diarrhea without red flags (short‑term only) [24].
- Antispasmodics (select cases; consider heat/emptying downsides) [58].

## 7) Stepwise evaluation and management algorithm for a masters runner with chronic/recurrent symptoms

Step 1 — Safety screen and scope
- Identify red flags (bleeding, severe pain, syncope, fever, anemia, weight loss, new changes ≥50 y). Urgent ED/CTA if acute severe pain “out of proportion.” Ensure CRC screening is up‑to‑date (start age 45) [17–19].

Step 2 — Initial outpatient work‑up (if no red flags)
- Labs: CBC, ferritin/iron, CMP, CRP; fecal calprotectin (±CRP) for chronic diarrhea [9–10].
- Celiac serology (tTG‑IgA/total IgA) [13].
- Targeted stool tests only with risk (Giardia) [10].
- If dyspepsia/ulcer features: noninvasive H. pylori test‑and‑treat if <60 y without alarms; endoscopy if ≥60 y or alarms [11–12].
- Consider SIBO breath test in selected risk settings; consider BAD testing (serum C4/FGF19) or therapeutic sequestrant trial when suspicion is high [14–15,52].
- Masters women with chronic watery diarrhea: colonoscopy with biopsies for microscopic colitis [16].

Step 3 — Immediate training/nutrition interventions (start now)
- Stop pre‑event NSAIDs; review PPIs/SSRIs in older women with watery diarrhea [16,47–50].
- 48‑h high‑carb low‑FODMAP preload before key long runs/races; reduce insoluble fiber 24–48 h [30–31].
- Practice fueling to 60–90 g/h of 2:1 glucose:fructose; keep drink CHO ~6–8% when volume is high; adjust gel/drink format to tolerance; consider hydrogel [33,35,42–43].
- Hydration: drink to thirst guided by weigh‑ins; avoid weight gain; incorporate sodium to taste and sweat rate in longer/hotter efforts [36–38,55–56].
- Caffeine: start low (1–3 mg/kg ~60 min pre‑start) and titrate; avoid late‑day high doses [39–41].
- Heat/altitude: acclimate; use pre‑cooling/ice slushies in heat; initially reduce intake rate at altitude and re‑train the gut there if feasible [5,7,51].
- Gut training: 2–3 sessions/week for ≥2 weeks with target fueling [42–43].

Step 4 — Targeted pharmacologic trials (if symptoms persist and work‑up negative for organic disease)
- Reflux/ulcer phenotype: 7–14‑day PPI trial; if long‑term needed, align with guidelines and monitor [20–21].
- Functional diarrhea episodes: loperamide on race day only (avoid if severe pain/fever/blood) [24].
- Recurrent nausea in ultras: ondansetron has not shown benefit over placebo; consider non‑drug measures first; if used, consider ODT 4–8 mg at symptom onset with caution [25].
- Probiotics: 4‑week multi‑strain Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium trial (start ≥4 weeks pre‑race) [44–46].

Step 5 — Reassess and escalate
- If symptoms remain limiting despite the above, or if tests are abnormal, refer to gastroenterology for advanced testing (e.g., endoscopy, BAD testing, SIBO management, imaging). Maintain graded return and continue practicing individualized fueling/hydration [8–16,18,52].

## 8) Key research gaps

- Masters‑specific data: Most trials include mixed adult cohorts; age‑stratified analyses are uncommon. Effects of aging on GI motility, permeability, and pharmacokinetics (e.g., caffeine) in runners need targeted study [1–4,39–41].
- Comparative trials of gel vs drink vs hydrogel formats in runners at high carbohydrate intakes with direct GI outcomes and performance endpoints [33–35].
- Standardized, athlete‑specific probiotic regimens (strain, dose, duration) and identification of responder phenotypes [44–46].
- Prevention and treatment of exercise‑induced ischemic colitis: prospective cohorts, risk models, and interventional studies (hydration protocols, vasodilators in selected cases) [8,57].
- Optimal hydration strategies across environmental extremes for symptom reduction (not just performance), including masters‑specific risks (EAH vs hypohydration) [36–38,55–56].
- Long‑term safety and real‑world adherence of low‑FODMAP preload strategies and gut‑training at high intake rates in older athletes [29–31,42–43].
