# Evidence‑based jet‑lag strategies for adult travelers (18–75) crossing ≥3 time zones

## Key points at a glance
- Human circadian timing advances with correctly timed morning light and delays with evening/late‑night light; practical real‑world adaptation averages ≈1 h/day eastbound and ≈1.5 h/day westbound, with faster delays than advances and large individual variability [1][2][31].  
- Bright light timing dominates spectrum; very bright morning light (or outdoor daylight) drives advances, while evening/late‑night light drives delays; even 30–50 lux of indoor evening light can measurably delay melatonin onset, so light avoidance is as important as active light exposure [3][4][5].  
- Melatonin works when timed to the phase‑response curve (PRC): for advances, small immediate‑release doses (0.5–1 mg) ≈5–6 h before target bedtime add to morning light; for delays, melatonin is usually unnecessary and bedtime dosing can counteract desired delays; IR outperforms CR for phase shifting [1][6][7][8][22][23].  
- Exercise has a human PRC: morning and early‑afternoon sessions advance; evening sessions delay; use as a secondary zeitgeber alongside light/melatonin [33][34].  
- Align meals to local daytime and avoid heavy meals at local night; meal timing has modest effects on the central clock but supports metabolic alignment and sleep onset (e.g., moderate‑carb dinner 3–4 h pre‑bed can shorten sleep onset) [35][36][39][40][41].  
- Caffeine improves daytime alertness during adaptation; use 100–200 mg in local morning and late morning or early afternoon, and stop ≥6–8 h before target bedtime; total intake ≤400 mg/day in healthy adults [1][42][44][45][46].  
- Strategic naps aid performance: 20–30 min “power naps” minimize inertia; 40–60 min naps give larger benefits if you can allow a 60–90 min buffer before critical tasks; avoid late‑day naps that delay bedtime, especially eastbound [50][51][53].  
- For short stays (≤48–72 h), stay on home time rather than re‑entraining; for ≥10–12 time zones, consider “going the long way” (initially delay even on eastbound trips) to adapt faster [1][2][11].  

## 1) How circadian timing shifts: what to expect and why timing matters
- The human clock advances with light after the late biological night/early morning and delays with light in late evening/biological night, best referenced to dim‑light melatonin onset (DLMO), which typically occurs ≈2–3 h before habitual sleep onset in healthy adults [3][12].  
- Classic laboratory PRCs show that a single 6.5–6.7 h bright‑light exposure yields maximal delays ≈2.6 h and maximal advances ≈1.3–2 h, with cumulative multi‑day effects; shorter exposures produce smaller shifts following the same timing pattern [3][4][15][16][17].  
- Spectrum matters less than timing for shifting phase; blue‑enriched light efficiently suppresses melatonin and can modestly enhance alertness, but comparable phase shifts can be achieved with broad‑spectrum bright light when photon dose and timing are matched [4][18][19].  
- Evening domestic light levels of 10–50 lux can delay DLMO by ~20–110 minutes depending on intensity and individual sensitivity, underscoring the importance of evening light restriction during eastbound adaptation and pre‑trip advances [5].  
- Practical real‑world adaptation averages ≈1 h/day eastbound and ≈1.5 h/day westbound; for very large eastward shifts (≥10–12 time zones), many adapt faster by delaying (“go the long way around”), then pivoting to advances [1][31][11].  

Evidence strength: Foundational PRCs (lab RCTs/controlled protocols), plus CDC clinician guidance (2025 online), and recent meta‑analyses in shift‑work analogs confirming timed light improves phase and sleep outcomes [1][3][4][7][8].  

## 2) Strategy‑by‑strategy effectiveness, timing, and outcomes

### A. Light exposure and light avoidance
- What works: Bright morning light for advances (eastbound), evening light for delays (westbound), and strict avoidance of light on the “wrong” PRC side using sunglasses, blue‑blocking glasses, caps, and dim environments; outdoors daylight (1,000–100,000 lux) is most effective when timing is correct, or use 2,000–10,000‑lux light boxes indoors [1][2][3][4][14].  
- Quantified effects: Lab PRCs show single‑day bright light can shift ≈1–2.6 h depending on timing/dose; intermittent light pulses can be efficient, and even very brief flashes during sleep can shift phase, though field relevance is still emerging; shift‑work meta‑analyses report significant phase shifts and ~+30 min total sleep time on average with bright light protocols [3][16][17][7][8].  
- Field RCTs in travelers: Mixed results with portable lights in athletes/cabin crew, likely due to timing/adherence constraints and competing zeitgebers; still, consensus guidelines support precisely timed light as the primary nonpharmacologic tool [13][1][2].  

Evidence strength: High (lab PRCs/RCTs, meta‑analyses); moderate in real‑world traveler trials given adherence/timing challenges [3][4][7][8][13].  

### B. Melatonin and melatonergic agonists
- Dosing/formulation: For phase shifting, immediate‑release (IR) melatonin 0.5–1 mg works well; 2–3 mg IR at bedtime may be added for sleep onset on the first 1–2 nights; controlled‑release (CR/SR) is less effective for shifting and can spill into the biological morning [1][22][23][25].  
- Timing: For advances, peak efficacy occurs ≈5 h before DLMO (≈5–6 h before habitual/target bedtime if DLMO is unknown); for delays, low‑dose melatonin in one’s biological morning can delay, but most westbound travelers should avoid bedtime melatonin initially because it can induce unwanted advances [24][1].  
- Outcomes: In travelers crossing 6–8 time zones, 5 mg IR and 0.5 mg IR improved sleep quality and daytime function vs 2 mg CR and placebo; Cochrane review concludes 0.5–5 mg near bedtime reduces jet‑lag severity, with IR > CR and stronger effects eastbound and with ≥5 time zones; NNT ≈2 in small dichotomous analyses [22][23].  
- Tasimelteon (melatonin‑receptor agonist): In an 8‑h advance RCT, tasimelteon 20 mg improved total sleep time by +60 to +86 min and reduced sleep latency by ~15 min, with better next‑day alertness; after real transatlantic travel, three nights of tasimelteon increased total sleep time by +131 min across nights and improved function; screen for CYP1A2/3A4 interactions [20][21][28].  
- Ramelteon: Small benefits on sleep latency in simulated advance; strong CYP1A2 interaction with fluvoxamine; overall jet‑lag evidence is modest relative to tasimelteon/melatonin [30][29].  

Evidence strength: Moderate–high for melatonin (multiple RCTs, Cochrane), high for tasimelteon in simulated and real eastbound settings (RCTs), lower for ramelteon in jet‑lag models [22][23][20][21][30].  

### C. Pre‑trip sleep schedule shifting
- Feasible rate: Advancing sleep by ~1 h/day supported by lab RCTs; 2 h/day caused adherence/sleep initiation problems; aligns with practical eastbound adaptation rates ≈1 h/day [7][8][1].  
- How to: Shift bedtime/wake earlier (eastbound) or later (westbound) by ~1 h/day for several days; pair with timed morning bright light for advances and evening light for delays; add 0.5 mg IR melatonin ≈5–6 h before the advancing bedtime if needed [7][8][9][24].  

Evidence strength: Moderate (lab RCTs, guideline endorsement) [7][8][1].  

### D. Exercise timing and intensity
- Human PRC: 60 min moderate exercise yields advances with morning/early‑afternoon sessions and delays with evening sessions; integrate as a secondary zeitgeber with light/melatonin [33].  
- Practical effects: Expect tens of minutes of phase shift over several days with repeated sessions; exercise also acutely improves alertness under circadian strain [33][34].  

Evidence strength: Moderate (human PRC, systematic review), with limited traveler RCTs [33][34].  

### E. Meal timing/fasting windows
- Central clock influence is limited: Shifting meal timing or short‑term TRE minimally affects central circadian phase when light/sleep are controlled; nevertheless, aligning meals to daytime supports metabolic alignment and may ease sleep timing [36][41].  
- Night‑work analog: Restricting eating to daytime prevented internal misalignment of glucose rhythms vs night‑time eating under simulated night work; practical translation is to avoid heavy meals during the biological night [35].  
- Argonne diet: Observational military report suggested less self‑reported jet lag, but methodologic quality is low; no high‑quality RCTs in travelers; use cautiously [37].  
- Composition: A high‑GI dinner 4 h pre‑bed shortened sleep onset latency by ~8.5 min; a lower‑protein/higher‑carb pattern over 3 days modestly increased melatonin and improved some sleep parameters; these promote sleep, not phase shifts [39][40].  

Evidence strength: Low–moderate for timing on central clock; moderate for metabolic alignment and sleep onset; low for Argonne fasting [35][36][37][39][41].  

### F. Caffeine for alertness while adapting
- Benefits: Repeated 200–300 mg doses improve PVT and reduce sleepiness under sleep loss/circadian stress; gum has faster onset (meaningful rise in ~5–15 min) than beverages/capsules; stop ≥6–8 h before target bedtime to protect sleep; total ≤400 mg/day for healthy adults [42][43][44][1][46].  
- Special cases: Armodafinil 150 mg morning for two days after a 6‑time‑zone eastbound flight improved objective sleep latency and subjective sleepiness; modafinil also improves aviation vigilance vs placebo; both are off‑label for jet lag and require medical oversight [48][49].  

Evidence strength: High for caffeine in sleep loss/circadian stress; limited jet‑lag‑specific RCTs; armodafinil/modafinil supported by RCTs but not first‑line [42][48][49].  

### G. Strategic naps
- Performance and sleepiness: 20–30 min naps yield quick, modest benefits with minimal inertia; 40–60 min naps provide larger performance benefits if you can allow ≥60–90 min before demanding tasks; avoid late‑day naps that delay bedtime, especially during eastbound advances [50][51][53].  

Evidence strength: High (meta‑analyses of naps on performance), with consistent recommendations for managing inertia [50][51][53].  

## 3) Direction‑, magnitude‑, and trip‑type‑specific routines

Below, “IR melatonin” refers to immediate‑release; default healthy adult, habitual bedtime ~23:00, wake ~07:00; adjust windows by chronotype and constraints.

### Eastbound (advance) routines
- 3–6 time zones, trip ≥4 days  
  - Pre‑trip (3–5 days): Advance sleep/wake ~1 h/day; morning bright light; optional 0.5 mg IR melatonin ≈5–6 h before earlier bedtime; avoid evening light; avoid late vigorous workouts [1][7][8][9][33].  
  - Arrival days 1–3: Avoid bright light if arriving in very early local morning until late morning; get 60–120 min outdoor light late morning/early afternoon; 100–200 mg caffeine in local morning and late morning only; stop ≥6–8 h pre‑bed; 30–60 min moderate exercise morning or early afternoon; one 20–30 min nap before ~15:00 if needed; low‑light wind‑down 3–4 h pre‑bed; IR melatonin 0.5–1 mg ≈5–6 h before target bedtime; optionally add 1–2 mg IR at bedtime on nights 1–2 if sleep onset is difficult [10][1][42][33][50][22].  
- 7–9 time zones  
  - Pre‑trip strongly advised (5–7 days) at ~1 h/day; same arrival anchors; consider tasimelteon 20 mg at local bedtime for first 2–3 nights if rapid recovery is critical (screen interactions) [1][7][8][20][21][28].  
- ≥10 time zones  
  - Option A (advance): Execute stricter early‑morning light avoidance on day 1; shift light exposure to mid‑morning; use IR melatonin 0.5–1 mg ≈5–6 h before target bedtime for 2–3 days; add 2–3 mg IR at bedtime nights 1–2 if needed [1][10][22].  
  - Option B (delay‑then‑advance): For very large eastward shifts, choose a 2–3 day delay strategy (evening light, morning light avoidance) to “go the long way,” then pivot to morning light/afternoon melatonin advances toward the local schedule [11][1].  

### Westbound (delay) routines
- 3–6 time zones, trip ≥4 days  
  - Pre‑trip (2–3 days): Delay sleep/wake ~1 h/day; avoid early‑morning exercise/light [1][33].  
  - Arrival days 1–3: Seek 60–120 min late‑afternoon/evening outdoor light; 30–60 min moderate exercise ending ≥3–4 h pre‑bed; use 100–200 mg caffeine early‑to‑mid‑afternoon only; avoid bright early‑morning light (sunglasses) and remain in dim light until target wake time; generally avoid bedtime melatonin initially to prevent unwanted advances [1][33][42].  
- 7–9 or ≥10 time zones  
  - Continue evening light emphasis for 2–3 days; if sleep is highly fragmented, consider 1–2 mg IR melatonin at local bedtime on nights 1–2 only, recognizing it may counteract delays; taper quickly [1][22].  

### Quick turnarounds (≤48–72 h)
- Maintain home time for sleep and meals; use sunglasses/blue‑blocking glasses to avoid unwanted daylight that would re‑phase you; use tactical 20–30 min naps and early‑day caffeine only [1][2][50][42].  

### Multi‑leg itineraries with layovers
- Track “internal time” against the final destination; during layovers, avoid strong light if it would push you in the wrong direction; seek light only when it aligns with your final plan; use apps/calculators or pre‑built schedules to manage complex routes [1][2].  

## 4) What improvements to expect (quantified)
- Phase shifting and re‑entrainment: ≈1 h/day eastbound and ≈1.5 h/day westbound in practice; with correctly timed bright light (± melatonin), larger daily shifts are achievable in lab conditions; many travelers adapt faster by delaying for very large eastward shifts [1][3][4][31][11].  
- Sleep metrics: Bright light protocols in shift‑work analogs add ~+30 min TST on average; tasimelteon 20 mg improved TST by +60 to +86 min after an 8‑h simulated advance and by +131 min across three nights after real transatlantic eastbound travel; sleep latency reduced by ~15 min in the simulated model [7][8][20][21].  
- Symptoms/jet‑lag scales: Melatonin near destination bedtime (0.5–5 mg IR) reduces jet‑lag severity and improves sleep and daytime function in RCTs; validated scales include the Liverpool Jet Lag Questionnaire/Index and Charité JetLag Scale for tracking symptoms in practice [22][23][2].  
- Daytime alertness/performance: Caffeine 200–300 mg dosing regimens improve PVT and reduce KSS sleepiness under circadian stress; bright/blue‑enriched light reduces subjective sleepiness and yields small‑to‑moderate performance gains during adverse circadian times [42][19][7].  

## 5) Safety, contraindications, and special‑population caveats
- Bright light: Generally safe with medical‑grade devices used as directed; seek ophthalmology advice if retinal disease, recent ocular surgery, or photosensitivity; minor transient side effects include headache/eyestrain; photosensitizing drugs/conditions warrant caution; bipolar disorder requires monitoring for rare manic switching with light therapy; “blue‑light hazard” concerns focus on high‑radiance point sources, not typical room/therapy levels [12][54][55][56][57].  
- Melatonin: Short‑term adult use is generally well tolerated; prefer USP‑verified products due to content variability and rare serotonin contamination; interactions include fluvoxamine (marked AUC increase), possible warfarin INR effects, and theoretical CYP interactions; avoid or use cautiously in pregnancy/lactation and epilepsy; coordinate with psychiatry in bipolar disorder given rare mania case reports; IR preferred over CR for phase shifting [26][27][23][22][25].  
- Tasimelteon/ramelteon: Screen for CYP1A2/3A4 interactions; tasimelteon should be avoided with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers; ramelteon is contraindicated with fluvoxamine; review labels before use [28][29].  
- Exercise: Screen for cardiovascular/musculoskeletal risk if initiating vigorous routines; avoid vigorous sessions within 3–4 h of bedtime [33][34].  
- Caffeine: Limit to ≤400 mg/day in healthy adults; avoid highly concentrated powders/liquids; in pregnancy, limit to <200 mg/day; individuals with anxiety, reflux, insomnia, or arrhythmias should individualize dosing, though usual intakes are generally safe in AF at the population level [46][45][47].  
- Naps: Plan a 15–90 min buffer after waking depending on nap length to allow sleep inertia to dissipate before critical tasks [53][50].  

## 6) Feasibility, adherence, and real‑world implementation
- Light delivery: Outdoor daylight is ideal when correctly timed; otherwise, use 2,000–10,000‑lux light boxes; evening light avoidance tools (sunglasses/blue‑blockers, dim lamps, screen filters) are practical and supported by physiologic studies showing evening light delays melatonin and by trials showing blue‑blockers can advance melatonin onset; airline and NASA programs increasingly use high‑melanopic day lighting and low‑melanopic pre‑sleep lighting to support entrainment, although passenger jet‑lag RCTs remain limited [5][18][14][2][60].  
- Exercise: Brisk outdoor walks or 30–60 min moderate sessions can be scheduled into morning or early evening windows per direction; bodyweight circuits and stairs work in hotels [33][34].  
- Meals: Airport/hotel constraints often drive schedules; the clearest rule is to align eating to local daytime and avoid heavy meals at local night during the first 2–3 days; modest higher‑carb dinners 3–4 h pre‑bed can aid earlier sleep onset eastbound [35][36][39].  
- Caffeine: Coffee/tea are ubiquitous; caffeine gum offers faster onset for critical tasks; stop ≥6–8 h pre‑bed [44][1][42].  
- Apps and schedules: CDC/Yellow Book endorses using calculators; commercial apps operationalize PRCs, but app‑specific RCTs are lacking; treat them as adherence tools anchored to the principles here [1][2].  

## 7) Practical schedules (ready to follow)

Use these as templates and adjust for your habitual sleep times and arrival clock.

- Eastbound (3–6 TZ, trip ≥4 days)  
  - Pre‑trip D‑3 to D‑1: Bed/wake earlier by ~1 h/day; 30–60 min outdoor/morning bright light; 0.5 mg IR melatonin ≈17:00 if target bedtime ≈22:00; strict low‑light evenings [1][7][9][24].  
  - Arrival D1–D3: Avoid strong light if arriving pre‑dawn local; begin outdoor light late morning; 100–200 mg caffeine at local breakfast and late morning; stop after ~14:00; 30–60 min moderate exercise morning/early afternoon; optional 20–30 min nap before ~15:00; IR melatonin 0.5–1 mg ≈5–6 h pre‑bed; optionally 1–2 mg IR at bedtime on N1–N2 only [10][1][42][33][50][22].  

- Westbound (3–6 TZ, trip ≥4 days)  
  - Pre‑trip D‑2 to D‑0: Bed/wake later by ~1 h/day; avoid early‑morning bright light [1].  
  - Arrival D1–D3: 60–120 min late‑afternoon/evening outdoor light; 30–60 min moderate exercise finishing ≥3–4 h pre‑bed; 100–200 mg caffeine early‑to‑mid‑afternoon; avoid morning bright light and stay dim until target rise; avoid bedtime melatonin initially [1][33][42].  

- Quick turn (≤48–72 h)  
  - Keep home sleep/meal schedule; tactical 20–30 min naps; small morning caffeine doses only; use sunglasses/blue‑blockers outdoors if local day would push your clock the wrong way [1][2][50][42].  

- Multi‑leg  
  - Stay aligned to final‑destination PRC; avoid layover light exposure that pushes the wrong direction; seek light only when it matches the final plan [1][2].  

## 8) Evidence grading (summary)
- Highest‑quality support (guidelines/meta‑analyses/RCTs):  
  - Timed light exposure/avoidance for phase shifting (lab PRCs, shift‑work meta‑analyses; guideline endorsement) [3][4][7][8][1][2].  
  - Melatonin IR timed to PRC for eastbound advances (Cochrane; RCTs; guideline endorsement) [23][22][1].  
  - Tasimelteon 20 mg at bedtime for large eastward shifts (two RCTs: simulated 8‑h advance and real transatlantic) [20][21].  
  - Caffeine for alertness/performance under circadian stress (multiple RCTs/operational trials; safety limits) [42][49][46].  
  - Strategic naps for performance (meta‑analyses) [50][51].  

- Moderate support:  
  - Pre‑trip 1 h/day sleep schedule shifts paired with timed light (lab RCTs; guideline endorsement) [7][8][1].  
  - Exercise timing PRC as adjunct zeitgeber (human PRC; systematic review) [33][34].  
  - Meal timing aligned to local daytime to reduce metabolic misalignment and aid sleep onset (night‑work RCT; sleep studies) [35][39].  

- Lower support/uncertain:  
  - Argonne fasting diet (observational; no high‑quality RCTs) [37].  
  - App‑based schedules (no RCTs of outcomes; feasible as adherence aids) [1][2].  

## 9) Important modifiers and planning notes
- Chronotype/age: Late chronotypes delay more easily (advantage westbound) and may need stricter evening light restriction eastbound; older adults often have earlier DLMO and lower light sensitivity, affecting shift rate and windows [12][5].  
- Flight type and arrival time: Overnight eastbound arrivals require early‑morning light avoidance and late‑morning exposure on day 1; daytime westbound arrivals benefit from evening light; CDC and educational resources provide worked examples [1][10].  
- Season/latitude: Short winter days or very early summer sunrises require devices and stricter morning avoidance; NASA operational lighting emphasizes high daytime melanopic stimulus and very low pre‑sleep melanopic stimulus to aid entrainment in constrained environments [14][60].  
- Cabin class/environment: Sleeping onboard reduces homeostatic sleep pressure but does not replace circadian timing interventions; airlines increasingly deploy dynamic cabin lighting, but rigorous passenger jet‑lag RCTs are limited [2][60].  
- Devices/access: If devices are unavailable, prioritize outdoor light timing, sunglasses/blue‑blockers, basic bodyweight exercise, and caffeine/naps within the windows above; evening screen light can delay DLMO, which is harmful eastbound but can be harnessed to assist westbound delays if needed [5][58].
