# Time‑efficient aerobic training in adults 30–70: comparative effectiveness of HIIT, MICT, and hybrid protocols (2018–2025)

## Executive summary
- Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max/VO2peak): HIIT generally improves VO2max more than MICT, especially when work intervals are ≥2 min and the per‑session “hard” time is ≥15 min; SIT shows no advantage over MICT; low‑volume HIIT (≤15‑min sessions, ≤5‑min hard work) matches or exceeds MICT gains with far less time [1][4][5][6][7][3][2].
- Glycemia/insulin resistance: In type 2 diabetes (T2D), HIIT lowers HbA1c, fasting glucose, and HOMA‑IR versus control; pairwise differences vs MICT are typically small or nonsignificant, but network meta‑analyses rank HIIT among the most effective modalities for HbA1c reduction [9][10][11][12][13].
- Blood pressure: HIIT may reduce central SBP and night‑time diastolic BP more than MICT; resting brachial BP changes are generally similar between HIIT and MICT in adults with elevated BP [15][14][16].
- Lipids/adiposity: In T2D, HIIT improves lipids vs control (↓TC, LDL‑C, TG; ↑HDL‑C) with no consistent superiority vs MICT; in overweight/obese populations, HIIT and MICT yield similar body composition changes; low‑volume HIIT reduces waist circumference vs control and matches MICT for fat percentage [11][17][3][2].
- Liver fat: HIIT and MICT both reduce intrahepatic lipids versus control with no clear difference between them; overall hepatic improvements occur independent of total minutes/volume [18][19][20].
- Patient‑centered outcomes: Supervised compliance is high and similar for HIIT and MICT; real‑world unsupervised adherence is moderate and similar; enjoyment/affect are similar or modestly higher with HIIT; adverse event rates during supervised cardiac rehabilitation are very low and comparable between HIIT and MICT [22][23][24][25][26][8].
- Time‑limited takeaway: For adults with <150 min/week—and especially <60 min/week—low‑volume HIIT and SIT/REHIT can deliver VO2max and multiple cardiometabolic benefits comparable to substantially longer MICT, with similar enjoyment and adherence under supervision and low adverse‑event rates in supervised settings [3][2][22][26].

## Population and comparators
- Population: Adults aged 30–70 years (evidence spans healthy, overweight/obese, cardiometabolic risk, hypertension, and cardiac rehabilitation) [1][4][16][6].
- Interventions:
  - HIIT: Repeated high‑intensity bouts typically prescribed at ~85–95% HRmax or near‑VO2max power/velocity for 1–4 min, interspersed with 1–3 min recovery; commonly 2–3 sessions/week [1][4].
  - SIT/REHIT (low‑volume HIIT family): 20–30 s “all‑out” sprints (Wingate‑style) on a cycle ergometer with long recoveries; classic REHIT uses ≤10–15 min sessions, ≤5 min total hard work, 2–3 sessions/week [5][3][2].
  - MICT: Continuous aerobic exercise at ~50–70% VO2max or ~60–75% HRmax; typically 3–5 sessions/week [1][5][17].
  - Hybrid HIIT+MICT: Alternating days or in‑session blends are used in some trials; enjoyment and retention appear similar to pure HIIT or MICT where examined [23].

## How protocols are operationalized and evaluated
- Session structures and intensities
  - HIIT exemplars: 4×4‑min at 85–95% HRmax with 3‑min recovery; 10×1‑min at ~90–100% v/pVO2max with 1‑min recovery; LV‑HIIT sessions ≤15 min with ≤5 min hard work; SIT 4–6×30 s “all‑out” with 3–4 min recovery [1][3][5].
  - MICT exemplars: 20–45+ min continuous at ~60–75% HRmax or 50–70% VO2max [1][5][17].
  - Progression: Workloads are progressed to maintain target HR or power across weeks; most trials report HR‑target adherence as the progression anchor [1].
- Weekly frequency and time commitment
  - HIIT/SIT: Typically 2–3 sessions/week; LV‑HIIT often 3× ≤15‑min sessions (≤45 min/week total) [3].
  - MICT: 3–5 sessions/week, often 30–60 min/session (commonly ≥150 min/week) [17][1].
- Delivery and monitoring
  - Predominantly supervised lab/clinic settings; heart rate monitors and cycle ergometer power output commonly used; treadmill/cycle modalities dominate [1][5][9].
- Outcome testing and assessment timepoints
  - VO2max/VO2peak via treadmill or cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing; glycemic markers via standard assays; BP by clinic or 24‑h ambulatory measures; liver fat by MRI/MRS; typical intervention durations 4–16 weeks, with some ≥12‑week cardiac rehab trials [9][14][18][1][6].
- Analytic approach/reporting quality
  - Meta‑analyses generally pool change scores with random‑effects; reporting of ITT vs per‑protocol is inconsistent in primary trials and often unclear in risk‑of‑bias assessments [5].

## Comparative effectiveness on key outcomes

### Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max/VO2peak)
- Adults across health states: HIIT improves VO2max more than MICT when intervals are long (≥2 min) and “hard” time ≥15 min per session; short‑interval, low‑volume, short‑term HIIT still robustly improves VO2max vs control [1].
- Middle‑aged/older adults (~50–70 y): Interval training (HIIT+SIT pooled) increases VO2max more than MICT by about +1.10 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹; HIIT and SIT each show similar advantages vs MICT [4].
- SIT vs MICT (healthy adults): No difference in VO2max change (Hedges g ≈ −0.004), with broadly similar effects across sex and baseline fitness subgroups [5].
- Cardiac rehabilitation: HIIT confers modest VO2peak advantages in general analyses, but differences diminish under isocaloric matching; longer (≥12 weeks), 3×/week HIIT produces the best gains [6][7].
- Low‑volume/time‑efficient HIIT: LV‑HIIT induces CRF gains similar to or greater than MICT despite much lower time/volume [3][2].

### Glycemic control and insulin resistance
- T2D pairwise meta‑analyses: Versus control, HIIT lowers HbA1c (~−0.34% to −0.80%), fasting glucose (~−13.3 mg/dL), fasting insulin, and HOMA‑IR, and increases VO2max; versus MICT, glycemic differences are generally not significant, while VO2max favors HIIT [9][10].
- T2D lipids/glycemia (broader synthesis): HIIT vs control improves TC (−0.31 mmol/L), LDL‑C (−0.31), TG (−0.27), fasting glucose (−1.15 mmol/L), HbA1c (−0.75%), and HDL‑C (+0.24); HIIT vs MICT shows no consistent differences overall, with some subgroup signals for HIIT when using moderate‑interval/moderate‑term designs [11].
- Network meta‑analyses: Across ≥12‑week trials, HIIT ranks among the best modalities for HbA1c reduction versus control (SUCRA high; modeled MD around −0.6% to −0.8%), rivaling combined aerobic+resistance training; supervision strengthens effects [12][13].

### Blood pressure and vascular outcomes
- Ambulatory and central BP: HIIT reduces night‑time DBP more than MICT in 24‑h ABP analyses and lowers central SBP by ~3 mmHg more than MICT; brachial SBP also modestly favors HIIT in some analyses [14][15].
- Hypertension/elevated BP: Resting brachial BP reductions are similar between HIIT and MICT, while VO2max gains favor HIIT; attendance/completion are comparable [16].

### Lipids, adiposity, and anthropometrics
- Overweight/obese adults: HIIT and MICT similarly improve weight, BMI, and total cholesterol; HIIT intervals ≥2 min or isocaloric matching favor greater VO2max, with HIIT sessions averaging ~9.7 min shorter than MICT [17].
- Low‑volume HIIT and body composition: LV‑HIIT matches MICT for fat mass/percentage and lean mass despite lower time/volume; CRF gains favor LV‑HIIT [2].
- Waist circumference: LV‑HIIT reduces waist circumference versus control and matches MICT for other adiposity indices [3].

### Liver fat/NAFLD (MASLD)
- MRI/MRS quantified hepatic fat: Both HIIT and MICT produce moderate reductions vs control with no difference between them; total program minutes/volume do not predict liver fat change [18].
- Additional syntheses: HIIT reduces liver fat vs control and improves enzymes; effects are broadly comparable to other exercise modalities across studies [19][20][21].

## Patient‑centered outcomes

### Adherence/retention
- Supervised compliance is high and similar: HIIT ~89% vs MICT ~92% (ns) across insufficiently active/clinical populations; unsupervised “real‑world” adherence is moderate and similar (HIIT ~63% vs MICT ~68%; very low‑certainty) [22].

### Enjoyment/affect
- Training enjoyment (PACES) and affect (Feeling Scale) are similar or modestly higher with HIIT vs MICT in adults with overweight/obesity; alternating HIIT+MICT arms show comparable enjoyment [23].
- Earlier syntheses report small enjoyment advantages for HIIT (PACES/EES) with trivial differences in affect; SIT enjoyment is comparable to HIIT and MICT, though very‑high‑intensity Tabata‑style formats can be less enjoyable for some participants [24][25].

### Adverse events and safety
- Supervised cardiac rehabilitation: Adverse events are rare and similar between HIIT and MICT, with one major cardiovascular event across ~17,083 HIIT sessions and no deaths reported during supervised training in pooled analyses [26][8].

## Minimal effective dose and maintenance strategies

### Minimal effective dose for meaningful gains under time constraints
- LV‑HIIT (≤15‑min sessions with ≤5‑min hard work, typically 3×/week; ≤45 min/week total) produces CRF, BP, and adiposity improvements comparable to MICT and high‑volume HIIT, despite requiring ~14–47% of MICT time; increasing intensity improves CRF, whereas adding sprints or extending sessions beyond low‑volume thresholds adds little additional benefit in pooled analyses [3].
- Broader low‑volume definitions (≤500 MET‑min/week) also show LV‑HIIT improves CRF more than MICT despite lower volume, though body composition changes are similar between modalities [2].

### Progression and maintenance over ≥6–12 months
- Longer programs and sustained frequency improve durability of VO2peak gains (e.g., ≥12 weeks, 3×/week HIIT in cardiac rehab analyses), supporting continued training to maintain benefits; explicit maintenance‑phase randomized comparisons remain limited across general populations [6][1].

## Subgroup/moderator insights for planned analyses
- Age: Middle‑aged/older adults (~50–70 y) show VO2max improvements with interval training > MICT (+1.10 mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) [4].
- Sex and baseline fitness: SIT vs MICT meta‑analysis found null subgroup effects by sex and baseline fitness for VO2max [5].
- Baseline cardiometabolic risk/medications: In T2D, HIIT consistently improves HbA1c and glycemia vs control and improves VO2max vs both control and MICT; supervision enhances HbA1c benefits across modalities in NMAs [9][10][12].
- Hypertension: HIIT and MICT similarly lower resting brachial BP; HIIT yields larger VO2max gains [16].
- Isocaloric matching: When total energy expenditure is matched, HIIT’s VO2peak advantage over MICT often attenuates in cardiac rehab populations [7].

## Practical delivery models under limited weekly time

- Supervised center‑based: Highest compliance and safety with HR/power telemetry; 2–3 HIIT/LV‑HIIT sessions per week (20–40 min for standard HIIT; ≤15 min for LV‑HIIT) [22][1][3].
- Hybrid supervised+home: Combine 1 supervised session with 1–2 home sessions using HR monitors and structured apps; supervision is associated with stronger glycemic outcomes in T2D [12].
- Fully home‑based: Feasible but yields lower adherence on average; prioritize simple LV‑HIIT/SIT protocols, clear HR/RPE targets, and remote monitoring to mitigate adherence gaps [22][3][5].
- Example time‑efficient templates:
  - LV‑HIIT: 3×/week, 10–15 min/session (e.g., 5‑min warm‑up; 4–5×30–60 s at ~90–100% v/pVO2max or ≥90% HRmax with 1–2 min easy recovery; brief cool‑down) [3][1].
  - SIT/REHIT: 2–3×/week, ≤10–15 min/session (e.g., 2–4×20–30 s “all‑out” cycle sprints with 2–4 min recovery; warm‑up/cool‑down included) [5][3].
  - Hybrid week: Alternate 1 HIIT day and 1 MICT day (e.g., 25–30 min at ~60–70% HRmax) to match preferences and recovery while staying <150 min/week [23][1].

## Alignment with major guidelines (context)
- WHO recommends at least 150–300 min/week of moderate‑intensity or 75–150 min/week of vigorous‑intensity aerobic activity for adults, noting that some activity is better than none—time‑efficient vigorous options can help time‑limited individuals approach benefits within the lower end of guidance [30].
- ACSM publishes standardized exercise testing/prescription guidance and intensity classification frameworks that underpin HR/VO2‑based prescriptions used widely in the trials synthesized here [31].

## Data extraction blueprint for the planned review
Capture for each trial arm and timepoint:
- Training prescription: modality/equipment; work:recovery structure and total intervals; target intensity (%VO2max, %HRmax, HRR, v/pVO2max, RPE); progression rules; weekly frequency; total session/weekly minutes; supervision vs home‑based; monitoring (HR, power, GPS). Definitions and monitoring approaches align with those reported across HIIT/MICT syntheses [1][5][9].
- Outcomes: VO2max/VO2peak test modality (treadmill vs cycle CPET); HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA‑IR; resting and/or 24‑h BP; lipids (LDL‑C, HDL‑C, TG, TC); adiposity (BMI, mass, waist, body fat%); liver fat/enzymes (MRI/MRS, ALT/AST) [9][14][18].
- Patient‑centered: adherence/compliance (attendance vs unsupervised completion), retention, enjoyment/affect instruments (e.g., PACES, Feeling Scale), adverse event definitions and rates [22][23][24][25][26].
- Analysis: ITT vs per‑protocol designation; handling of missing data; isocaloric matching where relevant; between‑group differences/effect sizes; absolute and percent changes; assessment timepoints (post‑intervention, maintenance/follow‑up) [5][7].

## Key caveats and gaps
- Many trials are short to moderate term (4–16 weeks), with limited randomized maintenance‑phase data beyond 6–12 months in general populations; longer, 3×/week HIIT programs in cardiac rehab show larger VO2peak gains, underscoring the value of sustained training, but generalizability needs study [1][6].
- Hybrid HIIT+MICT protocols are under‑represented as distinct arms in meta‑analyses, though available data suggest similar enjoyment and feasibility [23].
- Reporting quality (e.g., ITT vs per‑protocol, adherence definitions) is inconsistent across primary trials, complicating pooled inferences for some patient‑centered outcomes [5][22].
