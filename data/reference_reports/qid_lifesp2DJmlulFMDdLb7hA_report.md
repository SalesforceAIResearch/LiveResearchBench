# Comparative efficacy of protein targets, resistance training models, HIIT vs MICT, caloric deficits, and meal‑timing for body composition in recreationally active adults (18–35)

## Scope and population
- Population: Recreationally active, generally healthy adults aged 18–35 years (non‑elite).  
- Settings: Predominantly supervised trials; some free‑living.  
- Primary outcomes: Adiposity (body fat percentage, total fat mass, visceral fat) and lean body mass/fat‑free mass (FFM).  
- Secondary: Strength/performance, resting metabolic rate (RMR).  
- Evidence prioritized: RCTs/controlled trials, head‑to‑head designs, factorial trials, systematic reviews/meta‑analyses (2015–2025), and consensus guidelines.

## Executive summary (what works best and why)
- Resistance training (RT) alone reduces total body fat, visceral fat, and increases lean mass; pairing RT with dietary strategies yields the largest fat reductions while maintaining/gaining FFM [Effects of Resistance Training on Body Fat and Visceral Fat in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536199/) [RT With/Without Diet in Overweight/Obesity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191588/).  
- Protein intake: In energy balance, gains in FFM and strength plateau around ~1.5–1.6 g/kg/day with RT; in energy deficit, ≥1.8–2.4 g/kg/day better preserves or even increases FFM while enhancing fat loss [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/) [Higher compared with lower protein intake during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/).  
- Protein distribution/timing: Even vs skewed distributions do not improve body composition when total protein is matched; ~0.3–0.4 g/kg/meal (20–40 g high‑quality protein) is a practical per‑feeding target; pre vs post‑exercise protein is interchangeable if daily protein is sufficient; pre‑sleep casein can produce small added gains during RT blocks in young men [Evenly distributed protein led to no advantage during energy restriction](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657287/) [Dose of whey protein after whole‑body RT: 40 g > 20 g for MPS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4985555/) [Timing pre vs post protein produces similar adaptations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214805/) [Pre‑sleep casein increased muscle mass and strength in young men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25926415/) [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8) [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).  
- Protein quality: When total protein and leucine/EAA are matched, animal vs plant sources (including vegan diets with mycoprotein) yield comparable hypertrophy and strength across 8–12 weeks [Whey vs Soy with matched leucine: similar LBM/strength](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/11/3871) [Vegan mycoprotein‑rich vs omnivorous diet (~2 g/kg/d) during high‑volume RT: similar hypertrophy/strength](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36822394/).  
- RT programming: Linear vs undulating/block periodization produce similar strength and hypertrophy when work is equated over ≤16 weeks; distribute ~10–20 weekly sets per large muscle group across ≥2 sessions/week; hypertrophy is similar across low‑ to high‑load training when sets are taken close to failure; 2–3 min inter‑set rests benefit strength and large‑muscle hypertrophy [Linear vs Undulating Periodization Meta-analysis](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/04000/Systematic_Review_and_Meta_analysis_of_Linear_and.35.aspx) [Training frequency and hypertrophy meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/) [Weekly set dose–response meta-regression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/) [Low vs high load meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28834797/) [Failure vs non‑failure meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/) [3‑min rest better than 1‑min for strength/hypertrophy in trained men](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2016/07000/Longer_Interset_Rest_Periods_Enhance_Muscle.3.aspx).  
- HIIT vs MICT: Both reduce fat mass; interval training is at least as effective for total fat loss and may be superior for visceral fat reduction, with greater time efficiency when total work is appropriately prescribed [Interval training vs MICT for fat loss: meta-analysis](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/655) [HIIT and visceral fat reduction meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0835-7) [HIIT cardiometabolic health meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0751-3) [HIIT vs MICT cardiorespiratory fitness meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-015-0365-0).  
- Concurrent training: Combining RT with endurance training improves body composition; potential “interference” with maximal strength/hypertrophy can be minimized by placing RT before endurance, preferring cycling over running, and separating sessions by several hours [Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Training: Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00491/full).  
- Time‑restricted eating (TRE): With matched calories/protein and RT, 8–12 weeks of TRE reduces fat mass while maintaining FFM and strength; RMR is generally unchanged over 8 weeks; 12‑month TRE+RT in men lowered fat mass and improved metabolic markers without serious adverse events [TRE in trained males: fat loss, FFM/strength maintained](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0) [TRE in resistance‑trained females: similar FFM, more fat loss per‑protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268131/) [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).  
- Resting metabolic rate (RMR): Exercise interventions show small/variable effects on RMR; maintenance of fat‑loss/FFM relies more on ongoing training, adequate protein, and energy balance than expecting RMR to rise meaningfully [Exercise and RMR meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397898/).

## A) Protein targets, quality, timing, and feeding pattern

### Total daily protein (g/kg/day)
- In energy balance with RT, FFM and strength gains plateau near ~1.5–1.6 g/kg/day; additional protein above this seldom adds further FFM gains on average [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/).  
- During a large caloric deficit (~40% for 4 weeks) with structured RT/HIIT, higher protein (2.4 g/kg/d) increased LBM and reduced fat mass more than 1.2 g/kg/d [Higher compared with lower protein intake during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/).  
- Position statements recommend ~1.4–2.0 g/kg/day for most exercising adults, rising toward ≥1.6–2.4 g/kg/day in hypocaloric phases, with per‑meal targets ~0.25–0.4 g/kg (20–40 g) of high‑quality protein [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8) [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).

### Per‑meal distribution and leucine/EAA considerations
- Even vs skewed distribution: With total protein matched during 16‑week energy restriction plus supervised RT, even (30/30/30 g) vs skewed (10/20/60 g) protein produced no differences in fat or lean mass changes [Protein distribution during energy restriction and RT: no added benefit of even distribution](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657287/).  
- Per‑meal dose: After whole‑body RT, 40 g whey stimulated higher acute muscle protein synthesis (MPS) than 20 g in trained young men, supporting ~0.3–0.4 g/kg after large sessions [Dose of whey protein after whole‑body RT: 40 g > 20 g for MPS](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4985555/).  
- Practical: 3–5 protein feedings/day of ~0.3–0.4 g/kg each aligns with position stand guidance and supports meeting daily protein targets [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8) [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).

### Protein quality (animal vs plant; blends)
- When total protein and leucine/EAA are matched, whey vs soy supplementation during 12 weeks of supervised RT yielded similar LBM and strength gains in young adults [Whey vs Soy with matched leucine: similar LBM/strength](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/11/3871).  
- During 10 weeks of high‑volume RT at ~2 g/kg/day protein, vegan mycoprotein‑rich vs omnivorous diets produced comparable increases in DXA lean mass, thigh muscle volume (MRI), fiber CSA, and strength in young adults [Vegan mycoprotein‑rich vs omnivorous diet (~2 g/kg/d) during high‑volume RT: similar hypertrophy/strength](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36822394/).

### Timing relative to exercise and pre‑sleep
- Pre vs post: In trained men over 10 weeks, 25 g protein immediately pre vs post each session produced similar hypertrophy, strength, and body composition when daily protein intake was adequate [Timing pre vs post protein produces similar adaptations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214805/).  
- Pre‑sleep protein: In young men, ingesting ~27.5 g casein before sleep during a 12‑week RT program increased muscle mass and strength more than a noncaloric placebo [Pre‑sleep casein increased muscle mass and strength in young men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25926415/).  
- Nutrient timing consensus: When total daily intake is adequate, exact timing is flexible; protein around training is advisable, and carbohydrate timing is most relevant to support session quality/recovery for higher‑volume endurance/interval work [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8) [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).

### Time‑restricted eating (TRE)/time‑restricted feeding (TRF)
- Trained males (8 weeks, isocaloric, supervised RT): 16:8 TRE reduced fat mass with FFM and strength maintained; RMR unchanged [TRE in trained males: fat loss, FFM/strength maintained](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0).  
- Resistance-trained females (8 weeks, ~1.6 g/kg/d protein, supervised RT): FFM and strength similar across groups; per‑protocol analyses showed greater fat loss in TRE arms [TRE in resistance‑trained females: similar FFM, more fat loss per‑protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268131/).  
- Long term: 12‑month single‑blind RCT in men found TRE+RT lowered fat mass and improved cardiometabolic markers; no serious adverse events reported [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).

## B) Resistance training periodization and programming (volume, intensity, frequency, progression; minimal effective dose)

### Periodization models (linear vs undulating/DUP/block)
- Across short‑to‑medium terms (typically ≤16 weeks), linear, undulating, and block models produce similar strength when weekly work is equated; hypertrophy/body‑fat differences are not consistently demonstrated [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Linear and Undulating Periodization](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/04000/Systematic_Review_and_Meta_analysis_of_Linear_and.35.aspx).

### Frequency, weekly set volume, and distribution
- Frequency: With volume equated, higher vs lower weekly training frequencies yield similar hypertrophy; frequency mainly serves as a vehicle to distribute weekly volume [Resistance Training Frequency and Hypertrophy Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/).  
- Volume: Meta‑regression shows a graded hypertrophy response with increasing weekly sets per muscle; ≥10 sets/week per muscle tends to maximize average gains for trained populations, progressed sensibly over time [Dose–Response Relationship Between Weekly Sets and Hypertrophy Meta-regression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/).  
- Full‑body distribution may augment fat loss: In trained men over 8 weeks with matched weekly sets and loads, a distributed full‑body routine produced greater DXA‑measured fat mass loss than a split routine, with similar performance outcomes [Full‑Body vs Split Routine on Fat Loss with Matched Volume (DXA) RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38874955/).

### Load/intensity, proximity to failure, rest intervals
- Load: Hypertrophy is similar from low (≤60% 1RM) to high loads when sets are performed close to failure; heavier loads favor maximal strength [Low- vs High-Load Resistance Training for Muscle Hypertrophy and Strength Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28834797/).  
- Failure vs non‑failure: When volume is equated, hypertrophy and strength are broadly similar; training not always to failure reduces fatigue and may favor strength development at similar volumes [Effect of Training to Failure vs Non-failure Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/).  
- Rest: Longer inter‑set rests (≈3 min) improve 1RM strength and thigh hypertrophy vs 1‑min in trained men over 8 weeks [Longer Interset Rest Periods Enhance Muscle Strength and Hypertrophy](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2016/07000/Longer_Interset_Rest_Periods_Enhance_Muscle.3.aspx).

### Exercise selection, autoregulation, minimal effective dose
- Multi‑joint vs single‑joint: When volume is equated, multi‑joint‑only vs single‑joint‑only programs produced similar body composition and broad strength outcomes in active young men; base programs on multi‑joint lifts and add single‑joint work for specific targets [Multi‑Joint vs Single‑Joint Exercises on Strength and Body Composition](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29312007/).  
- Autoregulation vs %1RM: Autoregulated load prescription (RPE/RIR or velocity‑based) produces similar strength gains to fixed %1RM across short‑term studies; velocity‑loss thresholds ≤~25% tend to favor strength with good fatigue management [Autoregulation vs %1RM in Resistance Training Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038063/).  
- RT effects on body composition and RMR: RT reduces total and visceral fat and increases lean mass vs non‑exercising controls; chronic changes in RMR from exercise alone are small/variable [Effects of Resistance Training on Body Fat and Visceral Fat in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536199/) [Exercise and Resting Metabolic Rate in Healthy Adults Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397898/).

## C) HIIT protocols vs MICT, and concurrent training

### HIIT vs MICT for body fat and fitness
- Fat loss: Interval training (including HIIT and sprint interval training) and MICT both reduce total fat mass; pooled analyses show similar or slightly greater fat loss with interval training, with superior time efficiency [Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? Meta-analysis](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/655).  
- Visceral fat: HIIT appears particularly effective for reducing visceral adipose tissue vs control and at least comparable to MICT; several analyses suggest a potential advantage of HIIT for VAT reduction [Effect of HIIT on visceral fat mass in adults: meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0835-7).  
- Cardiometabolic fitness: HIIT produces equal or greater improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) compared with MICT in adults, including young, with smaller time commitments [HIIT cardiometabolic health meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0751-3) [HIIT vs MICT cardiorespiratory fitness meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-015-0365-0).

### Practical HIIT parameters
- Work intervals commonly target ≥85–90% HRmax or near‑maximal efforts for 15–90 s, with recovery intervals matched or slightly longer; weekly total work can be lower than MICT while producing comparable fat loss and larger fitness gains when adherence is high [Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? Meta-analysis](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/655) [HIIT cardiometabolic health meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0751-3).

### Concurrent training (RT + endurance) configuration
- To minimize potential interference with maximal strength/hypertrophy: perform RT before endurance work when sessions are combined, separate sessions by several hours when possible, and prefer cycling over running for endurance to reduce eccentric damage and residual fatigue [Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Training: Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00491/full).

## D) Caloric deficit magnitudes and targeted weight‑loss rates
- Large short‑term deficit example: A 40% energy deficit over 4 weeks combined with structured RT plus HIIT, when paired with high protein (2.4 g/kg/d), increased LBM and reduced fat mass more than a lower protein intake (1.2 g/kg/d) [Higher compared with lower protein intake during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/).  
- Continuous vs intermittent restriction: In resistance‑trained adults undergoing energy restriction, 2‑day weekly carbohydrate refeeds preserved FFM and resting metabolic rate better than continuous restriction at the same weekly energy deficit, while producing similar fat loss [Intermittent energy restriction with 2-day refeeds during RT](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00351-2).  
- RT plus dietary restriction typically yields greater fat loss than RT alone while preserving lean mass when protein is adequate [RT With/Without Diet in Overweight/Obesity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191588/).

## E) Meal‑timing protocols (protein/carbohydrate around training; TRE)
- Protein timing: Pre vs post feeding around training is flexible when daily protein is sufficient; ensure a protein‑containing meal within a few hours before/after training [Timing pre vs post protein produces similar adaptations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214805/) [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8).  
- Carbohydrate timing: Position statements recommend carbohydrate availability aligned to training demands to support performance/recovery, with total daily carbohydrate more influential for body composition than timing per se in resistance training contexts [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).  
- TRE: See Section A; TRE paired with RT reduces fat mass and maintains FFM/strength in short‑term trials; a 12‑month RCT showed sustained fat mass reductions without serious adverse events [TRE in trained males: fat loss, FFM/strength maintained](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0) [TRE in resistance‑trained females: similar FFM, more fat loss per‑protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268131/) [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).

## Outcomes by timeframe

### Short‑term (≤12 weeks)
- Protein: Increasing daily protein up to ~1.6 g/kg/day in eucaloric RT supports maximal FFM gains; in deficits, ≥1.8–2.4 g/kg/day preserves/increases FFM and accelerates fat loss [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/) [Higher compared with lower protein intake during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/).  
- RT models: Linear vs undulating/block produce similar hypertrophy and strength when volume is equated; distribute volume across the week (e.g., full‑body) as needed [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Linear and Undulating Periodization](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/04000/Systematic_Review_and_Meta_analysis_of_Linear_and.35.aspx) [Resistance Training Frequency and Hypertrophy Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/) [Full‑Body vs Split Routine on Fat Loss with Matched Volume (DXA) RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38874955/).  
- HIIT vs MICT: Both reduce fat; interval training offers time‑efficient benefits, including VAT reduction [Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? Meta-analysis](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/655) [Effect of HIIT on visceral fat mass in adults: meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0835-7).  
- RMR: Little to no increase with exercise alone; expect small/variable changes [Exercise and Resting Metabolic Rate in Healthy Adults Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397898/).

### Medium‑term (13–26 weeks)
- Protein distribution: Even vs skewed protein distribution during 16‑week energy restriction plus supervised RT does not change fat or lean mass outcomes when total protein is matched [Protein distribution during energy restriction and RT: no added benefit of even distribution](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657287/).  
- Combined RT + diet generally outperforms RT alone for fat mass reduction while preserving lean mass [RT With/Without Diet in Overweight/Obesity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191588/).

### Long‑term (>26 weeks)
- TRE + RT (12 months) sustained lower fat mass and improved metabolic health without serious adverse events [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).  
- Very high protein intakes (~2.5–3.3 g/kg/day) for up to one year in resistance‑trained men were not associated with adverse renal/hepatic effects under free‑living conditions; body composition is unlikely to change without progressive training stimulus [One-year high-protein crossover in trained men: safety](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2016/9104792).

## Maintenance strategies after initial fat‑loss/lean‑mass phase
- Continue structured RT (2–4 days/week; maintain ~8–15+ weekly sets/muscle) to maintain FFM and strength; RT alone reduces fat and maintains/increases FFM vs inactivity [Effects of Resistance Training on Body Fat and Visceral Fat in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536199/).  
- Maintain adequate daily protein (~1.2–1.6 g/kg/d in energy balance; higher targets if remaining in a deficit) to support FFM retention; timing is flexible as long as daily totals are met [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/) [Nutrition and Athletic Performance (ACSM/AND/DC)](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2016/03000/Nutrition_and_Athletic_Performance.25.aspx).  
- Utilize adherence‑supportive meal patterns (e.g., TRE or periodic carbohydrate refeeds) where helpful; TRE + RT supported lower fat mass over 12 months, and short, planned refeeds preserved FFM/RMR during energy restriction vs continuous restriction [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/) [Intermittent energy restriction with 2-day refeeds during RT](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00351-2).  
- Do not rely on increasing RMR for maintenance; exercise‑induced RMR changes are small/variable; focus on sustained energy balance and training [Exercise and Resting Metabolic Rate in Healthy Adults Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397898/).  
- Safety: High‑protein diets up to ~3.3 g/kg/day for 1 year in trained men showed no adverse renal/hepatic effects; supervised RT and TRE trials report minimal serious adverse events, supporting long‑term feasibility [One-year high-protein crossover in trained men: safety](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2016/9104792) [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).

## Subgroup effects, adherence, assessment methods, and adverse events
- Sex: Trials in trained women show similar qualitative responses (e.g., TRE preserves FFM; high‑protein plus RT supports FFM), though male‑only samples are more common [TRE in resistance‑trained females: similar FFM, more fat loss per‑protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268131/) [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/).  
- Training status: Protein supplementation effects on FFM are generally larger when baseline intake is low; diminishing returns above ~1.5–1.6 g/kg/day in trained adults [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/).  
- Body‑composition methods: Meta‑analyses report that scan‑based methods (DXA/MRI/CT) provide more conservative, reliable estimates than skinfolds; many RCTs use DXA and occasionally CT/MRI [Effects of Resistance Training on Body Fat and Visceral Fat in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536199/).  
- Adherence and AEs: Supervised programs frequently report ≥80–90% adherence among completers; adverse events are rare (e.g., isolated syncope during RT in a 16‑week diet+RT RCT) and long‑term TRE+RT trials report no serious events [Protein distribution during energy restriction and RT: no added benefit of even distribution](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5657287/) [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).

## Practical, evidence‑based prescription (integrating a–e)

- Protein
  - Energy balance: ~1.2–1.6 g/kg/day; 3–5 feedings of ~0.3–0.4 g/kg each; include one feeding within a few hours before/after training; source agnostic if EAA/leucine are adequate [A Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, and Meta-regression of the Effect of Protein Supplementation on Resistance Training–Induced Gains in Muscle Mass and Strength](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867436/) [ISSN Position Stand: Protein and Exercise](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8) [Whey vs Soy with matched leucine: similar LBM/strength](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/11/3871/) [Vegan mycoprotein‑rich vs omnivorous diet (~2 g/kg/d) during high‑volume RT: similar hypertrophy/strength](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36822394/).  
  - Cutting phase: 1.8–2.4 g/kg/day paired with RT and optionally HIIT/MICT; consider strategic 2‑day refeeds to support FFM/RMR [Higher compared with lower protein intake during an energy deficit combined with intense exercise promotes greater lean mass gain and fat mass loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26817506/) [Intermittent energy restriction with 2-day refeeds during RT](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-020-00351-2).
- Resistance training
  - 2–4 sessions/week; distribute ~10–20 weekly sets per large muscle group across ≥2 days; mix loads 30–85% 1RM; take most sets close to failure (approx. 0–3 reps in reserve); rest 2–3 min on compounds [Resistance Training Frequency and Hypertrophy Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30558493/) [Dose–Response Relationship Between Weekly Sets and Hypertrophy Meta-regression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27433992/) [Low- vs High-Load Resistance Training for Muscle Hypertrophy and Strength Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28834797/) [Longer Interset Rest Periods Enhance Muscle Strength and Hypertrophy](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2016/07000/Longer_Interset_Rest_Periods_Enhance_Muscle.3.aspx).  
  - Periodization: Choose linear or undulating/block based on preference and logistics—expect similar outcomes when weekly work is equated; consider full‑body frequency to distribute fatigue and potentially favor fat loss [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Linear and Undulating Periodization](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/04000/Systematic_Review_and_Meta_analysis_of_Linear_and.35.aspx) [Full‑Body vs Split Routine on Fat Loss with Matched Volume (DXA) RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38874955/).  
  - Autoregulate load/volume (RPE/RIR or velocity‑based) to manage fatigue and sustain progression [Autoregulation vs %1RM in Resistance Training Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038063/).
- Endurance training
  - Choose HIIT or MICT based on preference and recovery: both reduce fat; HIIT is time‑efficient and supports VAT reduction; for concurrent training, do RT before endurance, separate by hours when possible, and prefer cycling to reduce interference [Is interval training the magic bullet for fat loss? Meta-analysis](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/53/10/655) [Effect of HIIT on visceral fat mass in adults: meta-analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-0835-7) [Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Training: Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00491/full).
- Meal patterning
  - Timing is flexible when daily targets are met; TRE can aid adherence without compromising FFM/strength in the short term and can sustain fat loss over 12 months with RT [Timing pre vs post protein produces similar adaptations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5214805/) [TRE in trained males: fat loss, FFM/strength maintained](https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-016-1044-0) [TRE in resistance‑trained females: similar FFM, more fat loss per‑protocol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31268131/) [12‑month TRE + RT RCT in men](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34649266/).

## Limitations and research gaps
- Few head‑to‑head trials beyond 16–26 weeks in 18–35‑year recreational populations comparing different protein targets, periodization models, or HIIT configurations with DXA/MRI outcomes; most evidence is short‑term and male‑dominant [Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Linear and Undulating Periodization](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2015/04000/Systematic_Review_and_Meta_analysis_of_Linear_and.35.aspx) [Effects of Resistance Training on Body Fat and Visceral Fat in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34536199/).  
- Interference minimization strategies in concurrent training are supported by mechanistic and applied reviews; more long‑term RCTs with body‑composition endpoints in young, active adults are warranted [Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Training: Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00491/full).  
- RMR changes remain small/variable; maintenance relies on sustained behaviors (training, protein intake, energy balance) rather than expecting meaningful metabolic upregulation [Exercise and Resting Metabolic Rate in Healthy Adults Meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32397898/).
