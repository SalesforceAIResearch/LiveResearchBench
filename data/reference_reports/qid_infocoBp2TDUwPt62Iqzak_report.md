# GDPR fines > €50,000,000 (2022–2025): Final decisions

## Result
None found

As of 2025-09-16, no EU/EEA GDPR enforcement actions dated 2022-01-01 through 2025-12-31 with fines strictly greater than €50,000,000 are both (a) within scope and (b) final (i.e., no active appeal). All qualifying fines identified in this period are subject to ongoing appeals or judicial review, so they do not meet the “final decisions only” inclusion criterion.

## Why no entries qualify
- Meta Platforms Ireland Limited — €1,200,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; Facebook data transfers). Decision adopted 2023-05-12 and announced 2023-05-22. Meta has challenged the decision in the Irish courts; proceedings remain ongoing, so the decision is not final. See the DPC announcement and contemporaneous reporting on Meta’s appeal posture [1][2].
- TikTok Technology Limited — €530,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; EEA transfers to China). Decision dated 2025-05-02. TikTok was granted permission by the Irish High Court in July 2025 to challenge the decision, with a temporary stay on elements of the order; not final [3][4][5].
- TikTok Technology Limited — €345,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; children’s data/defaults). Decision adopted 2023-09-01. TikTok secured permission to bring a High Court challenge in October 2023; not final [6][7].
- LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company — €310,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; legal basis/consent). Decision dated 2024-10-22 (published 2024-10-24). LinkedIn has lodged a High Court challenge; not final [8][9].
- Uber B.V. and Uber Technologies Inc. — €290,000,000 (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, Netherlands; transfers of drivers’ data to U.S.). Decision adopted 2024-07-22 (published 2024-08-26). Uber has indicated it will appeal; press reporting confirms the challenge; not final [10][11].
- Meta Platforms Ireland Limited — €405,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; Instagram children’s data). Decision adopted 2022-09-02. Meta initiated High Court proceedings challenging the fine; not final [12][13].
- Meta Platforms Ireland Limited — €265,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; Facebook “dataset” scraping/design). Decision adopted 2022-11-25. Meta brought a statutory appeal; High Court adjourned aspects in 2024; still pending; not final [14][15].
- Meta Platforms Ireland Limited — €210,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; Facebook behavioral ads legal basis) and €180,000,000 (DPC, Ireland; Instagram behavioral ads legal basis). Decisions dated 2022-12-31 (published 2023-01-04). Meta stated it would appeal; challenges have been pursued; not final [16][17].
- Meta Platforms Ireland Limited — €251,000,000 total across two decisions (DPC, Ireland; 2018 “user token” breach inquiries). Decisions adopted 2024-12-12. Meta has challenged these decisions; not final [18][19].

Notes on scope:
- Several very large French CNIL penalties in 2022 (e.g., cookie consent cases) were imposed under the ePrivacy rules, not the GDPR, and are therefore out of scope for this list.
- Where an appeal is pending, the administrative decision exists and may be enforceable, but this brief requires “final decisions only; exclude currently appealed decisions,” so such cases are excluded until appeals are fully resolved.

## Research approach and verification
- Reviewed official DPA decision pages and press notices for each large fine to confirm decision dates, amounts, and cited GDPR articles.
- Verified appeal status and ongoing proceedings using reputable legal/press sources (e.g., RTÉ, The Irish Times, Reuters) and, where helpful, the EDPB’s communications.
- Cross-checked amounts and dates against the CMS GDPR Enforcement Tracker “Numbers and Figures” overview of top fines.
