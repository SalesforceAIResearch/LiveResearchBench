# Over‑Ear ANC Headphones, Compared (Aug 2025): Bose QC45, Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sony WH‑1000XM5, Apple AirPods Max, Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless

## Scope and criteria
Five popular over‑ear ANC models are compared on: (1) ANC performance, (2) sound quality/accuracy, (3) comfort/build, (4) battery/charging, and (5) U.S. pricing as of August 2025. Priority is given to primary specs and measurement‑based reviews. Where lab metrics weren’t captured in this dossier for a model, that is stated explicitly (see each section and table notes).

## Executive summary
- Best overall ANC: Bose QuietComfort Ultra (QCU) has top‑tier, full‑band attenuation and a wind‑reduction toggle; transparency is natural via Aware/ActiveSense. Measured full‑range ANC averages −27 dB, with strong mid/treble suppression and solid bass cancellation; Noise Isolation score 9.3/10 (RTINGS v2.0) [Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones Wireless Review (RTINGS)][1]; [Bose – QuietComfort Ultra Headphones product page][2].  
- Strong runner‑up ANC and features: Sony WH‑1000XM5 cancels less bass than QCU but cancels very well in mids/treble, with adaptive/transparency features (Ambient Sound, Speak‑to‑Chat). Measured full‑range ANC −25.81 dB; Noise Isolation 9.1/10 (RTINGS v2.0). No dedicated wind‑reduction mode [Sony WH‑1000XM5 Wireless Review (RTINGS)][11]; [Sony Help Guide – features][13].  
- Best battery life: Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless advertises 60 hours of playback with ANC, with quick‑charge (5 min → up to 4 h), making it the endurance pick; measurement‑grade ANC and FR metrics are available at RTINGS (not re‑reported here) [MOMENTUM 4 Wireless (Sennheiser)][23]; [Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Review (RTINGS)][22].  
- Apple AirPods Max delivers excellent ANC and class‑leading transparency with highly premium build; Apple claims 20 hours of battery life with ANC and spatial audio enabled; Lightning charging; Heaviest in the group (~385 g) [AirPods Max (Apple)][21]; [AirPods Max Review (RTINGS)][20].  
- Bose QC45 is light and comfortable, with effective ANC and 24‑hour battery claim; it’s the value‑oriented Bose option versus QCU. Full lab metrics available at RTINGS (not re‑reported here) [Bose QuietComfort 45/QC45 Review (RTINGS)][18].

Pricing (Aug 2025): MSRPs (list) commonly observed—Bose QC45 $329; Bose QCU $429; Sony XM5 $399.99; Apple AirPods Max $549; Sennheiser Momentum 4 $349.95. Concrete August‑2025 street‑price examples are included where captured (e.g., XM5 $328 promo ending Aug 25, 2025 at Best Buy) [Best Buy – WH‑1000XM5 search (Aug 2025 promo)][16]; [Bose QCU product/spec pages][2][3]; [Apple AirPods Max][21]; [Sennheiser Momentum 4][23].

## Analysis: key trade‑offs and recommendations
- ANC supremacy and wind handling: Bose QCU’s measured ANC is best overall in this set (higher full‑band average and robust mid/treble attenuation). Wind Block is a practical advantage outdoors. XM5 is very close in mid/treble but lets in a bit more low‑frequency rumble and has no wind‑reduction toggle [1][11][2].  
- Sound accuracy: Both QCU and XM5 measure with low distortion; XM5 shows excellent group‑delay behavior and solid spatial metrics; QCU has slightly warmer bass and a down‑tilted upper treble that some will find smoother but less airy. For rigorous FR/THD details on QC45/AirPods Max/Momentum 4, consult their RTINGS entries [1][11][18][20][22].  
- Comfort and weight: If weight is critical, XM5 (~250 g) and QCU (~254 g) are the lightest; AirPods Max is significantly heavier (~385 g) but uses premium materials. Clamp force for QCU/XM5 is light (~0.8 lb in lab), aiding long‑session comfort [1][11][21].  
- Battery: For marathon battery life, Momentum 4 is unmatched (claimed 60 h with ANC; quick 5 min → 4 h). XM5 and QCU both meet a full day with ANC in independent tests; AirPods Max claims 20 h and uses Lightning rather than USB‑C [23][11][1][21].  
- Pricing (Aug 2025): List prices differ substantially (AirPods Max $549; QCU $429; XM5 $399.99; Momentum 4 $349.95; QC45 ~$329). Confirm current street prices before buying; captured August‑2025 promo example: XM5 $328 at Best Buy (deal ended Aug 25, 2025) [16][3][21][23][18].  
- Platform/features: XM5’s feature set (Speak‑to‑Chat, Quick Attention, LDAC, multipoint) is rich on Android; QCU’s Aware/ActiveSense and Immersive Audio will appeal to users prioritizing transparency and spatial DSP; Apple’s seamless iOS integration and premium build may outweigh weight/battery trade‑offs for iPhone users [2][13][21][11].

## Notes on discrepancies and availability
- Firmware/ANC changes: RTINGS did not measure ANC regressions across XM5 firmware updates tested; user anecdotes exist but are not measurement‑verified. Bose QCU’s published firmware notes through 1.6.7 did not list ANC changes; RTINGS’ unit was tested on 1.6.7 [11][15][4][1].  
- Pricing volatility: Official list prices are stable references; promo prices vary frequently. Where an August‑2025 retailer price was captured, it is cited with the page showing the promo window (XM5 at Best Buy). For other models, August‑specific retailer snapshots were not captured in this dossier; consult official stores and major retailers for current pricing [16][2][3][21][23].  
- Unavailable metrics: For QC45, AirPods Max, and Momentum 4, detailed ANC band‑attenuation, FR/THD, and some comfort metrics were not reproduced here; refer to the linked measurement pages to retrieve the exact numbers [18][20][22].
