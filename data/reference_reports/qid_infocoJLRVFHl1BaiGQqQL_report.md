# ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AIMS) Certification Covering All Public Cloud Regions — Hyperscalers Status as of 1 July 2025

## Executive Summary
- Finding: No hyperscale cloud provider could be verified, via an accredited certification body’s public registry or equivalent primary source, as holding an ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Management System) certification whose scope explicitly covers all of its commercial public cloud regions as of 1 July 2025.
- Rationale: Public evidence available by 1 July 2025 indicates that initial ISO/IEC 42001 certifications among hyperscalers (where present) were limited to specific AI services or organizational units and do not unambiguously state coverage of all public cloud regions. Where providers maintain public certification pages, 42001 either is not listed at all or is presented without an all-regions scope statement. Certification body directories reviewed provide no clear, public entries showing a global, all-public-region scope for the provider’s entire public cloud footprint.
- Result: No providers qualify under the brief’s strict “explicitly covers all public cloud regions” criterion by the stated date.

## Scope and Verification Approach
- Required criterion: AIMS certification issued by an accredited CB, with the certificate scope (or CB listing) explicitly stating coverage of all public cloud regions (commercial regions open to general customers). Sovereign, government-only, air-gapped, or hosted/private clouds are out of scope unless explicitly included.
- Verification sources prioritized: Certification body public registries and directories; provider trust/compliance pages pointing to certificates; IAF/CB accreditations. Independent industry-news coverage was considered ancillary for confirmation but does not replace registry evidence.

## Providers That Do Not Meet the Criterion (with evidence)
The following hyperscale providers were reviewed because they are commonly cited by major analyst firms (e.g., Synergy Research, Gartner, IDC). For each, the issue is either: no public evidence of ISO/IEC 42001 certification by the date; or certification announcements/coverage that do not explicitly extend to all public cloud regions.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Status by 2025-07-01: No publicly verifiable ISO/IEC 42001 certificate in a certification body directory with a scope explicitly covering all AWS public regions. AWS’s public compliance program listing did not provide a registry-backed 42001 certificate with an all-region scope statement by the date.
- Reference: AWS Compliance Programs overview (does not show a public, registry-linked 42001 certificate with all-regions scope) [1].

### Microsoft Azure
- Status by 2025-07-01: Microsoft’s public compliance documentation did not present a certification body registry entry showing ISO/IEC 42001 coverage for all Azure public regions. Public materials around 42001 related to AI governance and specific AI services rather than an all-public-regions cloud scope.
- Reference: Microsoft compliance offerings index (no registry-linked, all-regions 42001 scope for Azure) [2].

### Google Cloud (GCP)
- Status by 2025-07-01: Google Cloud’s compliance portal did not provide a publicly accessible certificate registry entry demonstrating ISO/IEC 42001 scope that explicitly covers all GCP public regions. Early references to 42001 have focused on AI offerings rather than a whole-cloud global region scope.
- Reference: Google Cloud Compliance Resource Center (no public registry link evidencing all-region 42001 scope) [3].

### Alibaba Cloud
- Status by 2025-07-01: No public certification registry entry or Alibaba trust-center evidence of ISO/IEC 42001 covering all Alibaba Cloud public regions (including regions operated by separate entities) by the date.
- Reference: Alibaba Cloud Compliance & Trust Center (no 42001 all-regions scope shown) [4].

### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- Status by 2025-07-01: No public, registry-backed ISO/IEC 42001 certificate demonstrating an all-public-regions scope for OCI.
- Reference: Oracle Cloud Compliance (no 42001 all-regions scope shown) [5].

### IBM Cloud
- Status by 2025-07-01: IBM’s public compliance pages did not provide a registry-linked ISO/IEC 42001 certification with a scope covering all IBM Cloud public regions.
- Reference: IBM Cloud compliance overview (no 42001 all-regions scope shown) [6].

### Tencent Cloud
- Status by 2025-07-01: No public certification body directory entry or Tencent Cloud compliance page indicating ISO/IEC 42001 coverage spanning all public regions.
- Reference: Tencent Cloud compliance documentation (no 42001 all-regions scope shown) [7].

### Huawei Cloud
- Status by 2025-07-01: No public, registry-backed ISO/IEC 42001 certificate with scope explicitly covering all Huawei Cloud public regions.
- Reference: Huawei Cloud Trust Center (no 42001 all-regions scope shown) [8].

## Notes on Close or Ambiguous Cases
- Service- or product-specific certifications: Initial ISO/IEC 42001 certifications announced in the industry often pertained to specific AI services or organizational functions. Such scopes are narrower than “all public cloud regions” and therefore do not meet the brief’s requirement.
- “Global” language without region specificity: Generic statements like “global” or “worldwide” without an explicit mapping to all public cloud regions (or an attachment listing regions/locations) were considered insufficient.
- Separate legal entities and sovereign clouds: Where clouds operate in special jurisdictions (e.g., China regions operated by local partners) or have sovereign/government variants, there was no unambiguous, single certification scope clearly covering all such public regions as part of one cohesive public cloud offering by 2025‑07‑01.

## Conclusion
- As of 1 July 2025, no hyperscale cloud provider could be confirmed—using primary certification directories or provider trust centers—as having an ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification with a scope explicitly covering all of its public cloud regions. Providers may hold ISO/IEC 42001 certifications for subsets of AI services or internal AI management systems, but those do not satisfy the strict region-wide scope criterion in this brief.
