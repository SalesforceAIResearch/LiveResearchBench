## Inclusion criteria applied
- Consumer passenger vehicles only (cars/SUVs/minivans), not trucks, motorcycles, commercial/fleet‑only.
- Public rollout to production vehicles (factory at start of sales or broad OTA enablement) between 2023‑01‑01 and 2025‑09‑16.
- Assistants must be LLM‑based, able to handle free‑form queries and generative responses; traditional fixed‑grammar voice controls excluded.
- Smartphone mirroring assistants (e.g., Android Auto/CarPlay) excluded unless the OEM’s native assistant itself gained LLM capabilities.

## Confirmed rollouts table (brand‑level)
Notes:
- “Launch month” is the first public GA month (factory or OTA) as per OEM press; where exact day not stated, the first OEM publication month is used.
- LLM partner/model reflects disclosed providers at launch. Some OEMs route through an orchestration layer (e.g., Cerence Chat Pro, SoundHound Chat AI).
- Covered models are the initial set explicitly cited at launch; availability typically expanded thereafter.

## Brand‑by‑brand notes and caveats
- Volkswagen: GA in Europe from June 2024 via IDA with Cerence Chat Pro; U.S. availability followed later, but the first public rollout was EU.

- Audi: Two technical paths at GA — Azure OpenAI for legacy MIB 3 (OTA to ~2M vehicles) and Cerence Chat Pro for the new E3 1.2 platform (e.g., Q6 e‑tron). Coverage spans Europe and U.S. from July 2024. [Audi GA](https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/audi-enhances-voice-control-in-current-and-future-models-with-chatgpt-16068)

- Stellantis brands (Peugeot, Citroën, DS, Opel, Jeep): Programmatically leveraging SoundHound Chat AI to integrate OpenAI ChatGPT across many models and markets in 2024. Rollout cadence varied by brand and market, with DS (March 2024) and Peugeot (July 2024) among the earliest. Citroën and Jeep announcements explicitly call out ChatGPT integration; Opel confirmed broad availability by late 2024.

## Major brands investigated with no qualifying GA rollout in the window
- Mercedes‑Benz: The June 2023 U.S. ChatGPT program for MBUX was a limited, opt‑in beta; not a GA rollout. Next‑gen MBUX Virtual Assistant/Google Automotive AI Agent linkage arrives with MB.OS on future models beyond the GA window. [Mercedes beta](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovation/digitalisation/connectivity/car-voice-control-with-chatgpt.html)
- BMW/MINI: CES demos in 2024 around Alexa LLM and BMW’s multimodal concepts did not translate into an OEM press‑confirmed GA to customer vehicles within the time window. [BMW CES 2024](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0438991EN_US/bmw-at-the-consumer-electronics-show-ces-2024)
- Volvo/Polestar: “Google built‑in” Assistant is longstanding, with Gemini‑based enhancements indicated as “coming” in 2025; no OEM press confirming GA of an LLM in‑car assistant to customers within the period. [Volvo Gemini “coming”](https://www.volvocars.com/kh/news/technology/google-gemini-is-coming-to-your-volvo-with-google-built-in/)
- JLR (Jaguar/Land Rover): Alexa integration predates LLM wave; no OEM press identified confirming GA of an LLM‑based in‑car assistant in the period. [JLR Alexa (2022)](https://media.landrover.com/news/2022/02/land-rover-introduces-amazon-alexa-across-its-vehicle-portfolio)
- Renault: Cerence announced generative‑AI for “Reno” avatar; Renault 5 E‑Tech deliveries began in France in late 2024, but no Renault press found explicitly confirming GA of LLM capabilities at customer delivery timing; excluded to avoid over‑claiming. [Cerence‑Renault announcement](https://www.cerence.com/newsroom/press-releases/renault-and-cerence-partner-to-bring-generative-ai-to-reno-the-renault-connected-avatar)
- GM, Ford, Tesla, Lucid and others: Various AI announcements and OTA updates occurred, but no OEM press confirming a GA, in‑car LLM assistant to customer cars/SUVs in the window was identified. Lucid’s 2024 OTA highlighted voice features without LLM disclosure. [Lucid OTA (no LLM)](https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-delivers-ux-24-over-air-software-update-new-advanced/)

## Observations and trends
- Platform aggregators: VW Group leaned on Cerence Chat Pro as an orchestration layer to integrate LLM capabilities while preserving existing NLU pipelines, whereas Stellantis broadly standardized on SoundHound Chat AI for multi‑brand deployment. This helped turn LLM upgrades into software features spanning many models.
- Europe led first public rollouts: Most initial GA deployments occurred in Europe in 1H–2H 2024, with select rollouts (e.g., Audi) spanning the U.S. from the start of GA.
- OTA as an accelerant: Audi’s OTA to roughly two million MIB 3 vehicles underscores how software architectures and telematics pipelines can convert large installed bases quickly to LLM‑capable experiences.
- Assistant branding vs. underlying models: Many OEMs retained existing assistant names (IDA, Laura, IRIS, “OK PEUGEOT”), with LLMs embedded behind the scenes. Where orchestration platforms are used, multiple LLMs or retrieval sources can be swapped or combined over time.

## Methodological notes
- Only entries with a clear, public GA to production customer vehicles within 2023‑01‑01 to 2025‑09‑16 are included. Pilots, demos, limited trials, and features available solely via smartphone mirroring were excluded.
- Assistant names, LLM partners/models, launch months, and coverage are taken from OEM pressrooms. Independent confirmations are provided where available; if none was found, this is noted.
- If an OEM upgraded an existing assistant with LLM capabilities, it is counted only when the OEM confirmed public rollout to customer vehicles within the window.
