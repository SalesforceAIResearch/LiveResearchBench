# Should Modern Zoos and Public Aquariums Exist? A Global, Evidence-Based Assessment (2020–2025)

## Executive Summary
- Bottom line: Yes—conditionally. When accredited and operated to rigorous, transparent standards, modern zoos and aquariums can produce conservation, education, research, and community benefits that are difficult to replicate at scale. However, there are strong, evidence-based objections—especially for wide‑ranging, cognitively complex species (notably many cetaceans and some terrestrial megafauna), opportunity costs versus in‑situ conservation, environmental footprints, and uneven regulation of non‑accredited facilities. The sector’s legitimacy increasingly hinges on measurable outcomes, strict accreditation and enforcement, species‑appropriate welfare, climate responsibility, and collaboration with in‑situ partners.
- The table below presents exactly three strongest pro arguments and three strongest con arguments, each with thesis, evidence, analysis, metrics, case studies, stakeholders, and source links.

## Six Strongest Arguments (Three Pro, Three Con)

| Side | Argument Thesis | Supporting Evidence (year) | Reasoning/Analysis | Key Metrics/Outcomes | Notable Case Studies | Stakeholders Affected | Source URLs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pro | 1) Accredited zoos and public aquariums deliver measurable species conservation—from genetic management to reintroductions and ecological restoration. | • Scale and governance: EAZA manages 500+ EEPs; AZA has nearly 500 SSPs; 1,200+ studbooks in ZIMS; Red List now links to ZIMS ex‑situ data (2020–2024) [1][2][3][4]. • Genetic rescue/biobanking: Frozen Zoo holds 11,500+ cell lines from 1,300+ taxa; used for genetic rescue clones (BFF, Przewalski’s horse) (2020–2024) [5]. • Reintroductions since 2020 with government/SSC alignment: condors (USFWS), black‑footed ferrets (preconditioning, cloning milestones, 9,300+ bred), European bison downlisted, oryx downlisted with 85%+ survival, Guam kingfisher returned to wild (eggs laid 2025), Partula snails re‑established, white abalone 10,000+ outplants, Florida coral rescue/treatment at scale (2020–2025) [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. • Field funding: AZA members invested >$200M directly in 2023 (field only); broader estimate $350M; EAZA “tens of millions of Euros each year” plus €5.6M via campaigns; IUCN SSC 2023 recognizes “major contributions” (2023–2024) [19][20][21][22]. | Modern, accredited programs use population viability/genetics tools and globally coordinated studbooks, now integrated with Red List workflows, to prioritize ex‑situ roles within One Plan approaches. Results are strongest where ex‑situ breeding is tightly linked to reintroductions/restoration (condor, BFF, oryx, bison, Partula, abalone, corals). Aquariums play unique, non‑substitutable roles in marine invertebrate and coral rescue. | • 500+ EEPs; ~500 SSPs [1][2]. • 11,500+ cell lines; 2,300+ gametes banked [5]. • BFF: ~9,300 bred; ~250 kits/year; cloning added lost genetics [7][9]. • Oryx: >85% survival; IUCN downlisted to Endangered (2023) [11]. • Corals: 6,038 and 6,483 diseased corals treated in 2021–2022; ~2,000 rescued with 78% held at AZA sites [17][18]. | • Condor (USFWS). • BFF (USFWS/AZA SAFE; cloning). • European bison (IUCN). • Scimitar‑horned oryx (EAD/IUCN). • Guam kingfisher (USFWS/TNC). • Partula snails (ZSL/RZSS). • White abalone (NOAA). • Florida Reef Tract rescue (NOAA/AZA). | • Threatened species and ecosystems. • Indigenous and local communities in reintroduction areas. • Accredited zoos/aquariums; IUCN SSC networks; national agencies. | [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22] |
| Pro | 2) They educate at scale and generate science, data, and translational tools that support conservation decisions. | • Education meta‑analysis (56 studies, 2024): visiting/engaging with zoos/aquariums yields small‑to‑medium positive effects on knowledge, attitudes, self‑efficacy, intentions, and conservation behavior (d+ ≈ 0.40) [26]. • Research outputs: thousands of peer‑reviewed papers from EAZA/VdZ/AZA institutions; AZA facilities reported $15.8M in 2022 research across >600 taxa (1998–2022 range) [23][24]. • Conservation data infrastructure: Red List now highlights ex‑situ efforts via live ZIMS links; ZIMS for Medical supports wildlife health analytics and advisory networks (2024–2025) [4][25]. | The strongest aggregate evidence post‑2020 shows consistent, positive educational outcomes, though effects vary and are often short‑term. Simultaneously, the sector supplies decision‑grade data (studbooks, medical, husbandry) and peer‑reviewed science leveraged in recovery plans, health surveillance, and One Plan strategies. | • Education: d+ ≈ 0.40 across outcomes [26]. • Publications: >3,000 EAZA (1998–2018); >5,000 AZA (1993–2013) [23][24]. • ZIMS integrated into Red List (2024) [4]. | • Red List–ZIMS linkage and program planning. • Veterinary/health analytics informing conservation translocations. • Coral disease treatment protocols scaled via aquarium science. | • Visitors/learners. • Scientists/veterinarians. • Agencies (IUCN/SSC, USFWS/NOAA). • Educators and community partners. | [26][23][24][4][25] |
| Pro | 3) They contribute substantial economic and community benefits and provide crisis resilience that protects at‑risk wildlife. | • Economic impact: U.S. accredited facilities contribute ~$24B to GDP and >198,000 jobs (pre‑pandemic baseline) [36]. • Local multipliers: Erie Zoo study—~$21.2M annually to PA; ~$17.8M to Erie County (2022) [37]. • Crisis response/resilience: USFWS–AZA reimbursement waves (2022–2024) for endangered species care during COVID closures; UK Zoo funds supported operations (2020–2022) [38][39][40]. • Direct field support (2023): AZA members invested >$200M (field only) or ~$350M (broader tally); EAZA “tens of millions of Euros” annually (2023–2024) [19][20][21]. | Zoos/aquariums anchor local tourism and education economies while maintaining critical assurance colonies and rescue/rehab capacity during shocks (pandemic, disease outbreaks, coral crisis). Public support and relief recognize their quasi‑public‑good function in species safeguarding. | • ~$24B GDP; >198k jobs (US) [36]. • Local: ~$21M/year economic activity (Erie Zoo) [37]. • Relief: multi‑million USD/GBP grants maintained endangered species care [38][39][40]. • Ongoing field investments: $200–350M (AZA 2023) [19][20]; “tens of millions of Euros” (EAZA) [21]. | • Pandemic-era endangered species care (USFWS reimbursements). • UK Zoo Animals Fund. • Coral rescue networks maintained during crisis. | • Local businesses/workers. • Visitors/families. • Endangered species in human care. • Governments and donors. | [36][37][38][39][40][19][20][21] |
| Con | 1) Ethical and welfare concerns persist—especially for wide‑ranging, cognitively complex species (e.g., cetaceans, elephants, great apes). | • Elephants: Foot/musculoskeletal issues correlate with time on hard substrates/indoors; EEHV remains leading cause of juvenile mortality despite new mRNA vaccine trials (2020–2024) [28][29][30]. • Cetaceans: Severe dental wear and drilled teeth linked to oral stereotypies in captive orcas; global captive counts remain high; several jurisdictions restricting display/breeding (2017–2025) [31][32][33][34][35]. • Survival metrics improving in managed care for some marine mammals (Proceedings B, 2023), but ethical acceptability is debated; species‑specific needs (space, social structure, acoustic environment) are hard to meet under human care [27]. | Even where survival improves for some taxa, the moral question is unresolved for animals with complex cognitive, social, and ranging needs. For elephants, key morbidities (EEHV, feet) underscore ongoing husbandry challenges. For cetaceans, policy trends (Canada bans; France phase‑out/closures) mirror public ethics, irrespective of survival metrics. These concerns argue for species‑specific limits, transitions to sanctuaries, or phase‑outs. | • Elephants: >50% of juvenile deaths in some cohorts due to EEHV (retrospective); foot lesions prevalent and management‑linked [29][28]. • Cetaceans: 50+ orcas still in captivity globally (2025); multiple national/state prohibitions emerging [32][33][34][35]. | • EEHV vaccine pilot (Houston Zoo); continued juvenile risk. • France: Marineland Antibes closure linked to law banning shows/breeding. • Canada: national restrictions on cetacean captivity/breeding. | • Highly cognitive/social species. • Keepers/veterinary teams. • Public and ethicists. • Legislators/regulators. | [28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][27] |
| Con | 2) Opportunity costs and environmental footprints can be high relative to some in‑situ alternatives. | • Cost‑effectiveness: Classic analysis shows orders‑of‑magnitude higher per‑area costs for ex‑situ institutions than protected‑area management, implying many conservation goals are cheaper to achieve in situ when feasible (contextual baseline) [53]. • Environmental footprint: Organizational LCA of a wildlife park found visitor transport dominated GHG (~57.5% of total); on‑site energy/water use still significant; aquariums are energy‑intensive due to life support systems (2024–2025; earlier engineering baselines) [41]. • Even leaders need major investments to cut emissions (e.g., Aquarium of the Pacific fuel cell supplying >80% on‑site power, ~50% footprint cut; Zurich heat from biomass/heat pumps) (2019–2025) [42][43]. • Philanthropy and policy are increasingly prioritizing in‑situ 30×30 goals (POP Challenge $5B; GBF targets), potentially diverting funds unless ex‑situ projects demonstrate field impact [54]. | Where species can be saved in situ, investments in protected/conserved areas often yield greater biodiversity per dollar. Many zoo/aquarium GHG footprints are dominated by visitor travel and energy‑intensive exhibits; while leaders show large reductions, sector‑wide decarbonization and travel demand management are essential. Donor priorities are moving toward in‑situ protection unless ex‑situ work is tightly coupled to species recovery. | • O‑LCA hotspot: ~57.5% of GWP from visitor transport [41]. • Facility examples: 50% GHG cut (AOP); 98% heat from low‑carbon sources (Zurich) [42][43]. • POP Challenge: $5B committed to protected/conserved areas [54]. | • Facility‑wide LCAs; energy retrofits (VFD pumps, heat recovery, renewables). • Visitor mobility programs; transit partnerships. • One Plan projects that link ex‑situ to in‑situ targets. | • Donors and taxpayers. • Local governments/transport agencies. • Species reliant on in‑situ habitat protection. | [53][41][42][43][44][54] |
| Con | 3) Regulatory gaps and uneven standards—especially among non‑accredited exhibitors—create welfare, safety, and zoonotic risks; educational effects are positive but heterogeneous. | • Compliance: Non‑accredited exhibitors have significantly more AWA noncompliances than AZA‑accredited peers (JAAWS, 2022); APHIS continues to suspend/revoke licenses and issue penalties annually (FY2024) [45][46]. • Public safety: Federal Big Cat Public Safety Act (2022) bans cub petting/private possession; early prosecutions in 2024–2025 show ongoing risks outside accredited sector [47][48]. • Zoonoses: COVID‑19 infections across zoo taxa prompted >11,000 doses of Zoetis vaccine donations; H5N1 closures/avian die‑offs; elephant TB remains an occupational hazard requiring stringent controls (2021–2025) [49][50][51]. • Education: 2024 meta‑analysis shows positive effects but with heterogeneity and frequent short‑term self‑reports—underscoring the need for rigorous, longer‑term behavior verification [26]. | Strong accreditation improves compliance and emergency preparedness, but thousands of licensed exhibitors operate below top standards. This unevenness erodes public trust and creates avoidable welfare/safety risks. Even where education effects are positive, institutions should adopt proven behavior‑change techniques and verify lasting impact. | • FY2024: 16 AWA license suspensions/revocations; 39 settlements; 19 orders (APHIS) [46]. • BCPSA prosecutions underway (2024–2025) [48]. • >11,000 vaccine doses to ~70 zoos (COVID‑19); bird flu‑related closures/deaths (2021–2025) [49][50]. | • BCPSA enforcement (tiger‑cub case). • NYC avian flu investigations/closures. • Elephant TB exposure controls (CDC/NIOSH). | • Animals/public/keepers. • Accredited vs. non‑accredited facilities. • Regulators/prosecutors. • Educators/researchers. | [45][46][47][48][49][50][51][26] |

## Synthesis and Recommendation
- Should modern zoos and public aquariums exist? Yes—under clear conditions that maximize conservation value and minimize harms:
  - Accreditation and enforcement: Limit public funding and policy privileges to facilities meeting rigorous, independently audited standards (e.g., AZA/EAZA/WAZA-aligned), with transparent welfare, conservation, climate, and education performance. The evidence shows accreditation correlates with better compliance and lower welfare risk than the non‑accredited sector [45][46].
  - Species‑appropriate scope: For taxa with persistent welfare deficits in human care (e.g., many cetaceans; some elephants/great apes in specific contexts), adopt strict decision frameworks: default to in‑situ protection; if ex‑situ is necessary, use large, enriched, socially appropriate settings or accredited sanctuaries; consider phase‑outs where needs cannot be met. Jurisdictional trends (Canada/French bans) reflect this ethical direction [34][35].
  - One Plan integration: Tie ex‑situ work to explicit Red List/Recovery Plan targets, with published metrics on genetic diversity retained, post‑release survival, and contribution to downlisting (condor, BFF, oryx, bison, Partula, abalone, corals) [6][7][9][10][11][14][16][17][18][22].
  - Education with impact: Scale interventions that incorporate tested behavior‑change techniques and verify durable actions (beyond immediate post‑visit self‑reports) [26].
  - Climate and footprint: Conduct organizational LCAs; address the visitor‑transport hotspot; invest in energy efficiency and low‑carbon heat/power (fuel cells, heat pumps, biomass), as leading facilities demonstrate [41][42][43][44].
  - Funding allocation: Where in‑situ protection is more cost‑effective, direct a larger share of revenues and philanthropy to field partners—aligning with GBF/30×30 donor priorities—while reserving ex‑situ for clear assurance, research, or rehabilitation needs [53][54].

## Regional and Facility-Type Notes
- Accredited vs. non‑accredited: The strongest benefits and lowest risks concentrate in accredited institutions with audited programs (ARCS/SAFE; EEP LTMPs), while many publicized failures arise in non‑accredited/roadside facilities. Prioritize policy tools (e.g., BCPSA) to shrink the high‑risk fringe [45][46][47][48].
- Aquariums vs. terrestrial zoos: Public aquariums are uniquely capable of coral/invertebrate rescue and marine restoration (Florida/SCTLD; abalone), but are energy‑intensive and must lead on decarbonization [17][18][16][41][42].
- Species differences: Evidence of success is strong for some birds/ungulates/invertebrates (condor, bison, oryx, Partula, abalone) and mixed or ethically contested for large‑brained, wide‑ranging taxa (elephants—EEHV, feet; orcas—dental/behavioral issues) [6][10][11][14][16][28][29][31][32][35].

## Uncertainties and Data Gaps
- Comparative “success rates” by taxon, isolating accreditation effects, are not consistently published sector‑wide; outcomes remain program‑specific.
- Education research often relies on short‑term self‑reports; more longitudinal, verified behavior data are needed despite positive meta‑analytic findings [26].
- Environmental benchmarking is improving but uneven; more organizational LCAs and standardized GHG/water/waste reporting would enable cross‑institutional targets [41].
- Sanctuary welfare evidence and costs are still developing; case progress shows benefits are not automatic or rapid, and scale‑up is capital‑intensive.
