# U.S. Retail 2005–2025: How E-Commerce, Store Closures, and Adaptive Reuse Are Reshaping Communities

## Executive Summary
- E-commerce accelerated from roughly low double digits pre-2020 to mid-teens of total retail sales, reaching 16.3% of seasonally adjusted retail sales in Q2 2025; quarterly/annual time series provide full 1999–2025 context [1]. This shift—combined with pandemic-era disruptions—pressured department stores, softgoods chains, and B/C malls, raising closures and bankruptcies while pushing logistics growth.
- National store closures re-accelerated: 7,325 closures vs 5,970 openings in 2024 (net −1,355). Analysts expected as many as ~15,000 closures in 2025 as restructurings widened; mid-2025 closures were running far ahead of 2024 [6][7][8][13].
- Retail real estate is tight on average (Q2 2025 availability 4.9%; vacancy ~4.3%), but mall vacancy is materially higher (~8.8%), underscoring the bifurcation between neighborhood/strip/power centers and challenged enclosed malls [31][32][33].
- Employment composition evolved. Retail jobs are near pre-pandemic levels (15.588M, Aug 2025), while transportation and warehousing employment hit record highs post-2020, reflecting the logistics build-out; restaurants recovered to 14.319M by mid-2025 [12][15][13][14].
- Consumers adopted omnichannel habits: larger roles for BOPIS/curbside, persistent online grocery, and elevated returns (2023: $743B, 14.5% of sales; 2024: $890B projection) [35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42].
- Vacant retail is being reused. Creative, documented redevelopments include:
  - Logistics/last-mile (Randall Park Mall → Amazon FC; ~2,000 jobs) [53][58][59][60].
  - Mixed-use/housing/transit districts (Phoenix Metrocenter → $850M “The Metropolitan”) [61][62][63][64].
  - Education/civic anchors (Highland Mall → Austin Community College Highland campus; ~1.2M sf, 20,000+ students) [66][67].
  - Sports/medical/community (Seattle Northgate → Kraken Community Iceplex + district planning for housing/retail) [46][49][50][51][52].
  - Downtown infill replacing aging mall (CityPlace Burlington: housing incl. affordable, hotel, retail; TIF-backed public streets) [71][72][73][74].

Together these trends widened place-to-place disparities: strong neighborhood and open-air centers in growth markets; stressed B/C malls in slower-growth or older suburbs; and a pivot toward mixed-use, housing, health, education, and logistics as communities rebuild tax bases.

## 1) National Trends, 2005–2025

### 1.1 E-commerce and Sales Mix
- Quarterly Retail E-Commerce Sales:
  - Q2 2025: e-commerce $304.2B SA; total retail $1,865.4B SA; share 16.3% SA. Not-adjusted share 15.5% [1].
  - Time series (1999–2025) shows a steady 2005–2019 rise (roughly low double digits by 2019) with a pandemic-era surge and sustained mid-teens penetration through 2025 [1].
- Annual Retail Trade (ARTS) by category (2022): total retail trade $7.04T (+8.0% YoY). Electronic shopping/mail-order houses (NAICS 4541) $1.12T (+9.5% YoY), underscoring the structural channel shift [2][3][4].

### 1.2 Store Openings/Closures and Bankruptcies
- 2024: 7,325 closures vs 5,970 openings (net −1,355) [6][7].
- 2025 outlook: ~15,000 closures vs ~5,800 openings (Coresight projection); mid-2025 closures were already outpacing 2024 sharply [6][7][8][13].
- Historical context: closures peaked in 2020 (~9,700) before easing in 2021 (openings > closures), but restructuring waves continued among mall-based and home goods chains [8][6][7].
- Notable bankruptcies shaping vacancies: Toys “R” Us (2017–2018), Sears (2018), J.C. Penney (2020), Bed Bath & Beyond (2023) [various primary news/filings: 2017–2023] [35].

### 1.3 Employment, Wages, and GDP by Industry
- Employment (BLS CES, SA):
  - Retail Trade: 15.588M (Aug 2025) [12].
  - Transportation & Warehousing: series shows post-2020 records amid e-commerce/logistics expansion (downloadable via BLS CES) [13][14].
  - Accommodation & Food Services: 14.319M (Jun 2025), reflecting recovery and co-tenancy ties to retail traffic [15].
- Wages (BLS IAG/QCEW): Retail average hourly earnings ≈ $21.66 (prelim Aug 2025). QCEW annual averages (2005–2024) allow comparisons of employment, total wages, and average weekly wages by NAICS 44–45, 48–49, 72 [16][17][18][19].
- GDP by industry (BEA): Retail and Transportation & Warehousing value-added series (current and real dollars; share of GDP) document the growing economic footprint of logistics alongside retail’s stable share [20][21][22][23][24][25][26].

### 1.4 Real Estate and Foot Traffic
- Retail real estate (national):
  - Q2 2025 availability 4.9%; net absorption −5.0M sf; asking rent $24.79 (+0.5% YoY) [31].
  - Vacancy ~4.3% (Colliers snapshot), with availability “well below” the decade average (tight supply despite macro headwinds) [32].
- By center type (Q2 2025): malls ~8.8% vacancy; neighborhood ~6.3%; strip/power under 5% (national roll-up) [33]. Single-tenant “general retail” had the lowest vacancy (~2.6%) and led rent growth in 2025 [34].
- Foot traffic recovery:
  - 2023 vs 2019: Open-air −1% to −1.5%; indoor malls −4.6% to −5.8%; outlets −8.5% to −9.7% (Placer.ai) [27][28].
  - Prime street retail: by Q4 2023, foot traffic reached 81% of 2019; expected to fully recover in 2024 and surpass 2019 in 2025 (CBRE using Placer.ai) [29][30].

## 2) Impacts on Local Economies and Jobs (2005–2025; focus 2020–2025)
- Local employment mix shifted from in-store roles to logistics, delivery, and curbside/BOPIS support. BLS CES shows retail jobs stabilizing while transportation & warehousing reached new highs post-2020; restaurants recovered with the return of foot traffic and co-tenancy benefits [12][13][14][15].
- Tax base effects are mixed:
  - Short-run: closures and mall declines can depress local sales/property taxes and reduce small-business spillovers.
  - Medium-run: successful redevelopments (e.g., logistics facilities, mixed-use districts, education/health anchors) rebuild assessed values and diversify revenue sources.
- Real estate tightness in neighborhood/strip centers supported rent stability; higher mall vacancy elevated hold times and capital costs for B/C assets, affecting municipal revenue timing (vacancy differentials documented by national broker research) [31][32][33][34].

## 3) What Is Happening to Vacant Retail Properties
Documented typologies and examples:
- Logistics/Last-Mile: Former mall → fulfillment center (Randall Park Mall, OH → Amazon; ~2,000 jobs; Port bonds + state tax credit) [53][58][59][60].
- Mixed-Use/Housing/Transit Districts: Aging mall → multi-phase urban village (Phoenix Metrocenter; ~$850M; new housing, retail, park space; supported by predevelopment financing; integrated with transit) [61][62][63][64].
- Education/Civic: Enclosed mall → community college campus (Austin ACC Highland; ~1.2M sf; bond-funded; workforce programs; phased 2014–2021) [66][67].
- Sports/Medical/Community: Mall site repositioned with NHL practice facility + health clinic + district plan enabling housing and retail (Seattle Northgate; Iceplex opened 2021) [46][49][50][51][52].
- Downtown Infill Replacing Mall: CityPlace Burlington—housing (incl. permanently affordable), hotel, and retail with TIF-backed public infrastructure; construction underway (targeted completion mid-2026) [71][72][73][74].

Barriers observed: site assembly and demolition costs, environmental/abatement, infrastructure upgrades, zoning/entitlement timelines, capital markets volatility. Success factors: strong public–private coordination; flexible zoning/adaptive reuse policies; targeted incentives (TIF, bonds, tax credits); anchor tenants/institutions; transit access.

## 4) Consumer Shopping Shifts (2020–2025)
- E-commerce penetration: sustained mid-teens share through 2025 after pandemic surge (full time series available; Q2 2025 SA share 16.3%) [1].
- Omnichannel adoption:
  - Use of pickup rose rapidly; 18% used curbside for their most recent purchase in 2022 (+66% YoY); 37% more consumers used pickup in 2022 vs 2021 (surveys) [39][40][41].
  - Mobile and social influences play a growing role, especially for younger adults (Pew) [42].
- Grocery e-commerce: $95.8B in 2023; early-2025 monthly sales around $10B, with pickup/delivery as durable behaviors (Brick Meets Click/Mercatus) [37][38].
- Returns as a cost center: $743B of merchandise returned in 2023 (14.5% of sales); retailers estimated $890B of returns in 2024 (16.9% of sales), with higher rates online (17.6%) than in-store (10%) [35][36]. Store networks are increasingly leveraged as return nodes, altering store economics and space needs.

## 5) City/Metro Case Studies (Diverse Regions and Community Types)

### 5.1 Seattle, WA (Urban Core; Northgate)

- Outcome: Site clearing completed; vertical development staged to deliver residential/retail/pubic realm over multiple years [61][62][63][64].

### 5.4 Austin, TX (Urban Core; Highland Mall → ACC Highland)
- Project: Austin Community College repurposed Highland Mall into a ~1.2M sf campus (phased since 2014; major opening 2022), serving 20,000+ students and workforce programs [66][67].
- Financing/Policy: General obligation bonds (e.g., $152.8M from 2014 voters) supported redevelopment; broader corridor utilizes Texas Chapter 311 TIF/TIRZ tools in some cases (state framework cited) [66][67][68][69][70].
- Outcome: Creation of an education/civic hub spurring adjacent private development and strengthening daytime population [66][67].

### 5.5 Burlington, VT (Small City; Downtown Mall → CityPlace Burlington)
- Project: Burlington Town Center mall demolished; CityPlace adds at least 350 housing units (70 permanently affordable), up to 350 hotel rooms, ~40k sf of retail, and structured parking; public streets funded via TIF upon delivery/increment realization [71][72][73][74].
- Governance/Finance: City–developer settlement and development agreements reset phasing; city’s Waterfront TIF supports public infrastructure with developer carry until milestones [72][73].
- Timeline/Outcome: Final plans set in 2024; completion targeted Summer 2026; project aims to restore urban street grid and tax base [71][74].

Barriers commonly cited: complex ownership, high demolition/abatement costs, infrastructure deficits, entitlement risk, slower leasing for non-core retail, and cyclical capital markets. Success factors: anchored by institutions (colleges/hospitals/teams), transit access, public–private alignment, phased financing, flexible mixed-use zoning, and clear community benefits (affordable housing, workforce training, public space).

## 7) Answers to the Research Questions

1) How have store closures, mall decline, and e-commerce growth affected local economies and jobs?
- Closures and mall stress concentrated in department store/softgoods chains increased vacancies and reduced sales/property tax receipts in many communities, especially those reliant on single-enclosed malls. National reports show higher mall vacancy (~8.8%) vs. sub-5% for neighborhood/strip/power centers [33].
- E-commerce growth (Q2 2025 share 16.3%) and omnichannel behaviors pushed employment growth toward transportation & warehousing while retail stabilized; restaurants rebounded with foot traffic recovery [1][12][13][14][15][29][30].
- Communities that repositioned assets (logistics, mixed-use, education/health) often saw faster job and tax-base recovery (e.g., ~2,000 jobs at North Randall; education/civic and mixed-use anchors in Austin, Seattle, Burlington, Phoenix) [53][66][49][71][61].

2) What is happening to vacant retail properties?
- Documented end-uses include logistics/last-mile, mixed-use/housing districts, education/civic campuses, health/medical, sports/recreation, and curated retail/food/entertainment nodes. Cases show demolition plus redevelopment (Phoenix), heavy adaptive reuse (ACC Highland), or partial reuse plus new-build (Northgate Iceplex and district housing) [61][66][49].
- Finance/policy tools: TIF/TIRZ, Port Authority bonds, state job tax credits, public bonds, and pre-development loans. Zoning and center plans are critical to enable intensity and mix [71][68][58][59][67][62][46].

3) How have consumer shopping habits changed?
- E-commerce penetration sustained mid-teens post-2020; grocery e-commerce stabilized around ~$10B/month in early 2025 after the pandemic spike [1][37][38].
- Omnichannel surged: BOPIS/curbside normalized, with pickup usage materially up in 2022 vs. 2021; stores serve as return and fulfillment hubs; returns remain elevated ($743B in 2023; $890B in 2024 projections), influencing store design and economics [39][40][41][35][36].
- Foot traffic recovered unevenly: open-air centers neared 2019 levels by 2023; indoor malls trailed slightly; prime street retail was on pace to surpass 2019 in 2025 [27][28][29][30].

4) What creative solutions have communities implemented and with what outcomes?
- Logistics conversion with job creation (Randall Park → Amazon; ~2,000 jobs; multi-agency finance) [53][58][59][60].
- Mixed-use transit districts replacing malls to diversify revenue and add housing/amenities (Phoenix Metrocenter; ~$850M; phased) [61][62][63][64].
- Civic/education anchors to stabilize demand and workforce outcomes (ACC Highland; ~1.2M sf campus; bond-backed) [66][67].
- Sports/medical/community activation to rebrand districts and drive daily traffic (Kraken Iceplex + clinic at Northgate) [49][50][51].
- Downtown infill with housing (including permanent affordability), hotel, retail, and restored street grid using TIF (CityPlace Burlington; under construction; targeted 2026) [71][72][73][74].

## 8) How to Monitor Outcomes Locally
- Use BLS QCEW annual averages by NAICS (44–45, 48–49, 72) to track employment and wages pre- and post-redevelopment [17][18][19].
- Pull CES monthly series for near-real-time employment changes [12][13][15].
- Track retail sales by kind of business in Census MRTS; annual ARTS tables for category-level shifts; quarterly e-commerce (QREV) for channel mix [1][2][3][4].
- Use broker market reports (CBRE/Colliers/Lee/NAR) for vacancy/rent and absorption trends by center type [31][32][33][34].
- Review city ACFRs and revenue forecast reports for sales/property tax impacts; examples include Seattle’s quarterly revenue reports and Burlington’s TIF documents [31][71] (and respective city portals).
