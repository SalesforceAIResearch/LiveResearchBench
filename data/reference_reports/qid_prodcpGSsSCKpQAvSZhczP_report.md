Standout features for SMB (entry tiers)
- Freshsales Growth offers strong channel integration (email/chat/phone) and basic workflows at $9/seat; Freshmarketer Enterprise gives affordable journeys and multi‑channel marketing with generous send caps; Freshdesk Growth covers core help desk automation and KB. Bots, sequences, auto‑assignment, and many AI capabilities need add‑ons or higher tiers [21][26][29][23][24][32][27][33].

## Key strengths, trade‑offs, and fit for ≤50‑employee teams

- HubSpot Starter
  - Strengths: Very approachable UI; unified CRM with built‑in meetings/calling, strong email tooling; predictable contact‑based marketing caps; clear upgrade path to full Workflows across Sales/Marketing/Service [5][6][7][11][12][37].
  - Trade‑offs: True multi‑step automation (Workflows) and sequences are not in Starter; SLAs/KB also require Service Pro [7][10][19][21].
  - Fit: Teams that want an easy start with asset‑level automation and are ready to upgrade to Pro for orchestration later.

- Zoho (CRM Standard + Campaigns Standard or Marketing Automation Standard + Desk Standard)
  - Strengths: Lowest entry cost for sales automation (CRM Standard) and email automation (Campaigns Standard) with unlimited emails; Desk Standard includes KB and workflows at $14/agent [10][14][20].
  - Trade‑offs: Assignment rules, webhooks, Blueprint, and Zia AI are locked to higher tiers; some limits (e.g., CRM mass email/day; Desk workflows/time‑based rules) can be restrictive at Standard [11][12][18][38].
  - Fit: Cost‑sensitive teams that can start with core workflows and basic email automation, and add journeys (Marketing Automation) or process control (Professional+) as they mature.

- Freshworks (Freshsales Growth + Freshmarketer Enterprise + Freshdesk Growth)
  - Strengths: Very affordable sales entry price; marketing journeys at low contact counts; strong help desk basics with upgrade path to omnichannel bots; good user ratings for ease of use [21][26][29][47][48].
  - Trade‑offs: Sales sequences and auto‑assignment start at Pro; marketing contacts sold in larger blocks when scaling; bots require separate session packs; multiple/custom SLA policies require Pro+ [23][24][26][32][30][31][33].
  - Fit: Small teams prioritizing low entry cost for sales + marketing journeys, with optional bots later via Omni and Freddy session packs.

## What remains to validate for a complete 7‑vendor view
The following vendors require verified pricing/feature sources to complete the matrix:
- Salesforce (Starter/Sales Cloud Starter/Professional/Service Cloud Starter; Marketing Cloud Account Engagement/Engagement) — collect U.S. pricing pages, automation matrices, and entry‑tier limits (e.g., Flow availability, SLAs, bots).
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 (Sales Professional vs Sales Enterprise; Customer Service Professional; Customer Insights – Journeys) — gather U.S. list prices, workflow/cadence limits, marketing email/journey quotas, support SLAs/bot caps.
- Oracle CX (CX Sales, CX Service; Eloqua/Responsys entry availability and SMB suitability) — confirm whether SMB‑oriented entry tiers exist and prices.
- Zendesk Sell (sales CRM) plus Zendesk Support (for support automation) — capture Sell plan automation (workflows, sequences) and Support’s triggers/macros/SLAs/chatbots at entry tiers, including integration points and caps.

## Notes on interpreting plan caps
- Always check the vendor’s in‑app plan comparison or calculator for current month pricing and limits before purchasing; several vendors adjust caps by plan and contact band (e.g., HubSpot email sends scale with “marketing contacts”; Freshmarketer sends scale as 20× contacts; Zoho Campaigns uses contact‑based tiers) [5][27][14][18].
