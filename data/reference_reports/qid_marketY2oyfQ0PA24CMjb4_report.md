# On‑Demand Delivery in North America and Europe (Jan 1, 2024 – Jun 30, 2025)

## Important note on evidence and scope
No source materials were provided in the prior messages, and live research access is not available in this chat. The brief requires rigorous, primary‑source citations (URLs and publication dates) for every factual claim. Producing a defensible market landscape for 2024–H1 2025 therefore requires fresh collection of filings, earnings materials, regulator notices, and press releases.

Below is a structured, decision‑ready framework that specifies exactly what will be delivered, how it will be evidenced, and where each required data point will be sourced. If you can enable web access or share your preferred sources, this can be populated into a fully cited report quickly. Until then, any numeric values would be speculative and would not meet your evidence standard.

## Deliverable structure (what you will receive once sources are pulled)

### 1) Market size and growth (GMV/GOV and platform revenue)
- Definitions:
  - GMV/GOV/Gross Bookings: total consumer spend including taxes, tips, and fees (company‑specific definitions will be stated and reconciled).
  - Platform revenue: reported revenue attributable to delivery/commerce segments, net of pass‑throughs (per issuer policy).
- Regions and countries:
  - North America: United States, Canada
  - Europe: United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland (plus other disclosed markets)
- Time periods and currencies:
  - FY 2024 (Jan–Dec 2024) and H1 2025 (Jan–Jun 2025), local currency with USD/EUR conversions at stated FX (spot on period end or average—approach disclosed explicitly).
- Outputs:
  - Region‑level totals and growth rates (2024 vs 2023; H1 2025 vs H1 2024) in GMV and platform revenue.
  - Country splits where disclosed; where not disclosed by issuers, triangulation using third‑party datasets will be clearly labeled as estimates.

Evidence sources to collect:
- Uber Technologies: Delivery segment “Gross bookings,” revenue by segment, regional disclosures (10‑K/10‑Q, earnings releases and decks, transcript Q&A).
- DoorDash: Marketplace GOV, Total Orders, revenue; US/International splits in shareholder letters and 10‑K/10‑Q.
- Just Eat Takeaway.com: GTV, Orders, revenue by region (North America/US, Northern Europe, UKI, Southern Europe & ANZ) from annual report, H1 trading updates.
- Deliveroo: GTV, Orders, revenue by UKI vs International from annual report and H1 trading update.
- Grocery/retail peers for context where relevant to “related on‑demand delivery” (e.g., Instacart, Gopuff, Getir/Flink) to frame grocery/quick‑commerce portions.

### 2) Segmentation
- Service line:
  - Restaurant delivery, grocery, convenience/retail, and quick‑commerce
  - Approach: use issuer disclosures (e.g., Uber’s non‑restaurant mix; DoorDash “Drive”/grocery partners; Deliveroo Editions/Hop where applicable), plus partner press releases (e.g., supermarket chains, pharmacy, convenience).
- Order type:
  - Delivery vs pickup (self‑pickup/click‑and‑collect) metrics where disclosed (DoorDash Pickup; Uber “Pickup”).
- Fulfillment model:
  - 3P marketplace vs first‑party/white‑label/last‑mile (DoorDash Drive/White‑Label, Uber Direct, Grubhub Direct, Deliveroo Signature).
- Customer type:
  - B2C vs B2B (corporate/catering/large order programs) and subscription vs non‑subscription (DashPass, Uber One, Grubhub+, Deliveroo Plus).
- Urban vs suburban:
  - Platform commentary and third‑party datasets (e.g., density expansion statements, suburbs performance remarks in earnings calls). Where quantitative splits aren’t disclosed, clearly noted as qualitative only.

Evidence sources to collect:
- Product/merchant pricing pages, help centers, and partner program pages (define models and fees).
- Earnings call transcripts for mix commentary (e.g., “non‑restaurant at x% of delivery GB,” “pickup growth,” “white‑label growth”).

### 3) Demand drivers and challenges
- Demand drivers:
  - Convenience, frequency/subscription programs, loyalty economics; inflation and menu pricing; promotional intensity; urbanization/mobility trends; assortment expansion (grocery/convenience).
- Challenges:
  - Unit economics and contribution margin; competitive intensity and subsidy unwind; driver supply dynamics; regulatory/pay floors; commission/fee caps; litigation/settlements; VAT/tax changes.
- Regulatory context by market:
  - US: NYC delivery worker minimum pay rules; Seattle PayUp; municipal/state commission caps (status, litigation, changes).
  - Canada: any province/city fee caps still active or expired.
  - UK: employment status jurisprudence; CMA actions where relevant.
  - EU: Platform Work Directive status/timeline; Spain Riders Law; France social dialogue minimums; country case law (e.g., Netherlands/Germany decisions).

Evidence sources to collect:
- Regulator sites (laws, rules, enforcement pages).
- Official press releases from cities/states/provinces and EU/Member States.
- Company litigation/PR statements and financial impacts where disclosed.
- Reputable media summaries linking to primary texts.

### 4) Competitive benchmarking (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Deliveroo)
- Market share by order volume and/or GB/GTV:
  - Region and country level where disclosed; triangulate with credible third‑party datasets (e.g., YipitData, Bloomberg Second Measure, Similarweb, Sensor Tower, Apptopia) and explain methodology differences.
- Delivery time performance:
  - Where companies disclose “median delivery time” or “on‑time rate,” capture definitions (store‑to‑door vs order‑to‑door; marketplace vs white‑label).
- Commission and merchant fees:
  - Standard plan tiers, take rates, small‑order fees, service/delivery fees, and local regulatory caps; show geography‑specific differences.
- Unit economics/profitability:
  - Contribution profit/margin, segment EBITDA/margin, segment operating profit where available.
- User metrics:
  - MAUs/active consumers, order frequency, subscription counts (DashPass, Uber One, Grubhub+, Deliveroo Plus) and disclosure scope.
- Geographic differentiators:
  - Coverage density, suburban vs urban strength, last‑mile/Drive/Direct networks, grocery/retail integrations, autonomous/robot pilots.

Evidence sources to collect:
- Issuer filings, quarterly decks and letters, press releases.
- Merchant pricing/help center pages:

### 5) Partnerships (2024–H1 2025)
- Catalog by category:
  - QSRs and fast casual (e.g., McDonald’s, Starbucks, Chipotle, Chick‑fil‑A, KFC, Burger King).
  - Grocery (e.g., Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, Costco; Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda; Carrefour; Ahold Delhaize banners; Aldi; Lidl; Rewe; Edeka).
  - Convenience/retail/pharmacy (e.g., 7‑Eleven, CVS, Walgreens, Boots, WBA/Alliance, Couche‑Tard/Circle K; electronics and general retail tie‑ins).
- For each: platform(s), exclusivity, start date, geographies/market coverage, notable tech integrations (POS, loyalty linking, white‑label/Direct fulfillment).
- Evidence: company pressrooms, joint announcements, and investor presentations.

## Measurement notes and reconciliation rules
- Terminology varies:
  - Uber “Delivery Gross Bookings” vs DoorDash “Marketplace GOV” vs JET “GTV” vs Deliveroo “GTV.” Each will be defined and reconciled with a mapping table and caveats (e.g., inclusion/exclusion of tips, taxes, first‑party, subsidies).
- FX:
  - Present native currency; provide USD/EUR conversions with source and date (e.g., ECB or Federal Reserve daily rates) and sensitivity if material.
- Growth:
  - Use reported or derived growth rates; when mixing disclosed and estimated splits, clearly mark which are modeled.
- Conflicting figures:
  - Present side‑by‑side, explain scope and method differences, and state why one is chosen for roll‑ups.

## What will be populated (illustrative, pending sourcing)
- Region GMV and platform revenue totals for NA and Europe, 2024 and H1 2025, with YoY growth.
- Country splits where available (US, CA, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, NL, IE).
- Segmentation tables:
  - Service line mix (% restaurant, grocery, convenience/retail, q‑commerce)
  - Delivery vs pickup
  - Marketplace vs white‑label
  - Consumer vs B2B; subscription penetration (% of orders/GB)
  - Urban vs suburban commentary and any available quant
- Competitive benchmarks:
  - Market share by orders and by GB/GTV (region/country)
  - Delivery time metrics and on‑time rates (with definitions)
  - Fee/commission structures and regulatory caps by market
  - Unit economics (contribution, segment EBITDA/margins)
  - Users: MAUs/active consumers, frequency, subscribers (DashPass, Uber One, Grubhub+, Deliveroo Plus)
  - Geographic differentiators and tech/logistics notes (e.g., autonomous pilots, dark stores, partnerships with robotics)
- Partnerships ledger (2024–H1 2025):
  - Flagship restaurant/grocery/retail deals with exclusivity, geographies, and integration features.

## Immediate next steps to produce the fully cited report
- Confirm permission to perform source collection (or provide your curated links).
- Approve the country list and segmentation dimensions; add any markets of special interest.
- Indicate currency presentation preference (native + USD, native + EUR, or all three).
- Provide any subscription datasets you want prioritized (e.g., YipitData, Second Measure, Similarweb).

## Delivery timeline (once research access is approved)
- Day 1–2: Collect issuer filings, quarterly releases, decks, transcripts; compile regulator links; harvest partnership press releases.
- Day 3: Normalize metrics and reconcile terminology; compute GMV/revenue roll‑ups and growth rates; draft segmentation tables.
- Day 4: Complete competitive benchmark, fee/commission mapping, regulatory context by country; assemble partnership catalog.
- Day 5: QA for citation coverage and consistency; deliver version 1 with full URL/date citations and a change log.
