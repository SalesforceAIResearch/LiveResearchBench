# U.S. Health Systems With Enterprise Rollouts of Ambient AI Clinical Documentation (Jan 1, 2021 – Aug 31, 2025)

## Executive Summary
No qualifying enterprise‑wide ambient AI clinical documentation rollouts were captured in the provided research materials. The supplied findings contained no press releases, trade coverage, or source URLs to validate announcements by U.S. hospitals or health systems within the specified timeframe.

This report documents the criteria used, presents a clean results table reflecting the current state of the provided corpus (no entries), and outlines a rigorous plan to quickly complete the dataset with verifiable sources.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Applied
- Inclusion:
  - U.S.-based hospitals/IDNs/AMCs (including single-hospital systems that operate as systems).
  - Announcement between 2021-01-01 and 2025-08-31 explicitly indicating enterprise/systemwide rollout of an ambient AI documentation tool that generates/drafts notes from clinician‑patient encounters.
  - Examples of qualifying products: Microsoft/Nuance DAX Copilot (incl. DAX Express), Abridge AutoScribe, Suki Assistant with Ambient, Ambience AutoScribe, Nabla Copilot, Augmedix Go/AI, Notable, DeepScribe.
- Exclusions:
  - Traditional dictation/speech recognition only (e.g., Dragon Medical One alone), manual scribe-only services without AI ambient note generation, pilots/department-limited trials unless clearly stated as enterprise expansion.
  - Non‑U.S. systems.
- Edge handling:
  - Multiple vendors per system allowed if multiple enterprise rollouts occurred.
  - Ambiguous scope excluded unless terms like “systemwide,” “enterprise,” or “across the health system” are present.
- Sourcing priorities:
  - Health system’s own newsroom/press page preferred; otherwise joint releases or official blogs; last resort is credible local news with clear flag.
  - Trade coverage from recognized health IT outlets (Becker’s, Fierce, Healthcare IT News, HIStalk, etc.).

## Results Table (Current State From Provided Research Corpus)
Health System | Vendor/Product | Go-Live Month (YYYY-MM) | Scope Notes | Health-System Press Release URL | Health-IT Trade Article URL
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
No qualifying announcements identified in the provided findings | — | — | The supplied research contained no system newsroom links or trade-press coverage confirming enterprise ambient AI rollouts within the timeframe. | — | —

## Quality Checks Performed
- Verified that no U.S. health system announcements, product names, go-live months, scope definitions, or URLs appeared in the provided materials.
- No duplicates, date-range mismatches, or non-U.S. entities were detected due to lack of entries.

## Gaps and Next Steps to Complete the Dataset
To produce the comprehensive, source-verified table requested, the following workflow is recommended:

1) System newsroom scans (confirm enterprise scope and dates)
- Search the official newsrooms of likely early adopters and large IDNs/AMCs for terms: “ambient,” “AI scribe,” “DAX,” “Abridge,” “AutoScribe,” “Suki,” “Augmedix,” “Nabla,” “Ambience Healthcare,” “Notable,” “DeepScribe,” “Copilot,” “generative AI documentation,” “enterprise,” “systemwide.”
- Validate announcement date falls within 2021-01-01 to 2025-08-31.
- Capture precise scope language (e.g., “across ambulatory clinics,” “all specialties,” “inpatient and ambulatory,” “expanding from pilot to systemwide”).

2) Vendor newsroom and joint announcements (cross-check)
- Search vendor newsroom pages for customer announcements naming the health system and explicitly stating enterprise/systemwide deployment. Prioritize joint releases or quotes from health system executives.
- Where only vendor press exists, include it with a clear note and backstop with credible local or trade coverage.

3) Trade press corroboration
- Search recognized outlets (Becker’s Hospital Review, Fierce Healthcare/Health IT, Healthcare IT News, Modern Healthcare, HIStalk, HIT Consultant, MedCity News, MobiHealthNews) using system name + product/vendor + “ambient”/“AI scribe.”
- Capture at least one trade article per rollout; avoid pure press release reposts when possible.

4) Data fields and labeling
- Health System: official name.
- Vendor/Product: standardized “Vendor/Product” (e.g., “Microsoft/Nuance DAX Copilot”).
- Go-Live Month:
  - Use actual go-live month; if only planned, label “planned” (e.g., “2024-11 (planned)”).
  - If only announcement date is available and go-live is not disclosed, enter “Not disclosed” and add announcement month in Scope Notes.
- Scope Notes: summarize breadth (enterprise/systemwide; ambulatory vs inpatient; specific service lines; pilot-to-enterprise expansion).
- URLs: link the system’s newsroom page and a recognized trade article.

5) Edge cases and disambiguation
- Distinguish ambient AI note generation from dictation tools without automated note drafting.
- For health systems with multiple ambient tools, create separate rows per vendor/product with distinct dates/scopes.

## Deliverable Readiness and Update Plan
- The table is currently empty because the provided research corpus had no entries. 
- Upon executing the steps above, expect dozens of qualifying entries from 2023–2025 as many U.S. systems moved from pilots to enterprise deployments of tools like Microsoft/Nuance DAX Copilot, Abridge AutoScribe, Suki Assistant with Ambient, Ambience AutoScribe, Nabla Copilot, Augmedix Go/AI, Notable, and DeepScribe.
- Turnaround: An initial, source-verified pass across top 150 U.S. IDNs and leading AMCs can typically be completed within 3–5 business days, with a long tail of community and regional systems in 1–2 additional weeks.
