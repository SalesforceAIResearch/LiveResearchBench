# US Cosmetics Brands That Hit 1M TikTok Followers and Launched a Creator Incubator in 2025

## Executive Summary
- No qualifying brands were found between Jan 1, 2025 and Sep 16, 2025 that satisfy both criteria:
  1) A US‑operating cosmetics brand with a parent listed on NYSE/Nasdaq whose brand TikTok account surpassed 1,000,000 followers for the first time in 2025 (confirmed via Social Blade), and
  2) Launched an official, brand‑run “creator incubator” program in 2025 (press release/newsroom + independent trade coverage).

- Multiple major US‑listed parents (e.l.f. Beauty, Estée Lauder Companies, Coty, Unilever ADR, P&G Beauty, Olaplex, Bath & Body Works) had brand activity on TikTok and creator‑led campaigns in 2025, but no brand met both the TikTok milestone timing and the 2025 creator‑incubator launch requirement concurrently.

- A set of “near‑misses” was identified, including ongoing creator collectives predating 2025 (e.g., Rimmel Creator Crew) or brands whose TikTok follower counts were already >1M prior to 2025 (e.g., e.l.f. Cosmetics, The Ordinary, Too Faced), or remained under 1M during 2025 (e.g., Bath & Body Works, Clinique).

## Scope and Definitions (Applied)
- Geography/Listing: Brands operating in the US whose parent companies are publicly traded on NYSE or Nasdaq; ADRs acceptable.
- Category: Cosmetics broadly (makeup, skincare, fragrance, haircare, body care); excludes tools unless the brand is primarily cosmetics.
- Brand TikTok account: Brand‑level handle; not corporate holding company accounts unless the corporate handle functions as the sole consumer brand presence.
- “Hit >1M TikTok followers”: First calendar date in 2025 when the brand TikTok account reached ≥1,000,000 followers, verified by Social Blade’s daily history and a screenshot showing the crossing. Must confirm it did not exceed 1,000,000 prior to 2025.
- “Creator incubator”: Brand‑run 2025 program to recruit, train, mentor, or fund creators (incubator/accelerator/fellowship/academy/creator program), with an official announcement and independent trade coverage.

## Method and Verification Notes
- Brands assessed across US‑listed parents (ELC, Coty, e.l.f. Beauty, Unilever ADR, P&G, Olaplex, Bath & Body Works, among others).
- Searched for: 2025 brand‑run creator incubator/accelerator/fellowship launches; simultaneous TikTok follower growth milestones.
- Where available, third‑party follower snapshots were used to contextualize scale relative to the 1M threshold (HypeAuditor, TikBuddy, etc.). These do not replace Social Blade for final verification but helped rule out candidates in scope or timing.
- Because no brands met both criteria, no Social Blade screenshots are included. If any brand is later identified, Social Blade crossing screenshots will be required for inclusion.

## Brand Checks: What Ruled Out the Candidates
- Estée Lauder Companies portfolio
  - Too Faced: circa 1.4M in early 2025; no 2025 incubator launch found; ongoing #TooFacedBFF creator program predates 2025 [2][14].
  - The Ordinary: circa 1.8M; already >1M prior to 2025; no 2025 incubator found [3].
  - Clinique, Bobbi Brown: well under 1M in 2025; no qualifying programs [5][6].
  - Corporate‑level creator support existed (NIV The Catalysts in 2024), but outside the 2025 brand‑run scope [22].

- Coty portfolio
  - Rimmel: Creator Crew launched in 2023; referenced in 2025 product PR; not a new 2025 incubator launch [11][12][13].
  - OPI, Sally Hansen: under 1M in 2025; no program launches [7][8].

- e.l.f. Beauty
  - e.l.f. Cosmetics TikTok leadership predates 2025; 2025 creator‑adjacent activation with Pinterest is a campaign, not a creator incubator [1][15].

- Unilever (ADR; NYSE: UL)
  - Tatcha under 1M in 2025; no program launch [9].
  - Vaseline ran a 2025 campaign with myth‑busting “Vaseline Verified”; not an incubator [18].

- P&G Beauty
  - No 2025 brand‑run creator incubator launches surfaced; historical creator‑led programs (e.g., Pantene Conditioner Collective) predate 2025 [19].

- Olaplex
  - Longstanding large TikTok presence with viral milestones long before 2025; 2025 PR focuses on campaign work, not a new incubator [10][20].

- Bath & Body Works
  - Account remained under 1M in mid‑2025; 2025 news flow emphasized retail expansion, not creator program launches [4][21].

## Limitations and Data Caveats
- Social Blade requirement: Inclusion requires a Social Blade daily history screenshot proving the first‑ever 1M crossing occurred in 2025. Because no matches were found, no Social Blade screenshots are attached.
- Third‑party follower estimates: HypeAuditor/TikBuddy/Collabstr figures were used only to contextualize likelihood of a 2025 crossing. They are not substitutes for Social Blade verification.
- Archive captures: The brief requests archives when possible. For excluded/near‑miss items, archival captures were not created, but can be added on request.
- Listing status: Unilever trades in the US via ADR (NYSE: UL). For brands under non‑US listed parents (e.g., L’Oréal/NYX), these were out of scope.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Ongoing monitoring through Dec 31, 2025:
  - Watchlist brands near 1M (e.g., Bath & Body Works; OPI) and capture Social Blade daily charts to verify any 2025 crossings.
  - Track brand newsroom/RSS and major trades (Ad Age, Adweek, WWD/Beauty Inc, Glossy, Digiday, The Drum, Marketing Dive, Modern Retail, BoF, Vogue Business) for any newly announced creator incubators in Q4 2025.
- If the brief can be widened:
  - Include brands with parents not listed in the US (e.g., L’Oréal/NYX, LVMH/Benefit), where creator academies/ambassador pipelines are more common.
  - Include corporate‑run creator programs (e.g., ELC NIV) as eligible, if brand‑level programs remain scarce in 2025.
