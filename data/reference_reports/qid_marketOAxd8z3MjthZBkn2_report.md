# COVID‑19 Vaccine Market 2021–2025: Global Size, Demand Phases, Company Comparison, and Outlook

## Scope, definitions, and methods
- Geography: WHO regions (AFRO, AMRO, EMRO, EURO, SEARO, WPRO) and World Bank FY2025 income groups (High, Upper‑middle, Lower‑middle, Low) for distribution views [WHO dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/vaccines) [3]; [World Bank income groups](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) [4].
- Volumes:
  - Administered doses: daily country series from Our World in Data (OWID); annual totals computed as end‑of‑year cumulative differences; cross‑checked with WHO’s 2021–2023 monthly and 2024 quarterly uptake files [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1]; [OWID dataset documentation](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccination-dataset) [2]; [WHO vaccines dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/vaccines) [3].
- Revenues: company‑reported product sales (Pfizer–BioNTech counted via Pfizer’s Comirnaty product revenue; BioNTech profit‑share excluded to avoid double‑count), plus ranges for non‑disclosing suppliers when necessary; all inputs cite company SEC filings or official press [Pfizer 2023 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800324000039/pfe-20231231.htm) [8]; [Pfizer 2022 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800323000024/pfe-20221231.htm) [9]; [Pfizer FY2021 press](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/1382146/PFE/pfizer-reports-fourthquarter-and-fullyear-2021-results) [10].

## Executive summary
- Volumes collapsed post‑mass rollout. Based on OWID’s global series, annual doses administered fell from roughly 9.2B in 2021 to about 4.0B in 2022, then to a few hundred million per year in 2023–2024 as vaccination shifted to seasonal boosters in higher‑risk groups (EU 2023–24 ≈31.3M doses; U.S. 2024–25 season ≈30.8M through mid‑April 2025), with very low 2025 YTD totals to date [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1]; [ECDC 2023–24 report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5]; [CDC COVIDVaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html) [6].
- Revenues peaked in 2021–2022, then normalized. Disclosed product sales indicate at least ≈$80B in 2021 and ≈$60B+ in 2022 from major manufacturers alone (Pfizer Comirnaty $36.8B in 2021; $37.8B in 2022; Moderna Spikevax $17.7B in 2021; $18.4B in 2022; AstraZeneca Vaxzevria $3.9B in 2021; $1.9B in 2022; J&J ≈$2.5B in 2021; Sinovac $19.4B in 2021), followed by steep declines in 2023–2024 (Pfizer $11.2B in 2023; 2024 vaccine revenues not broken out but company guided ~$8B combined Comirnaty+Paxlovid; Moderna $6.7B in 2023 and $3.1B in 2024) [Pfizer FY2021 press](https://marketchameleon.com/PressReleases/i/1382146/PFE/pfizer-reports-fourthquarter-and-fullyear-2021-results) [10]; [Pfizer 2022 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800323000024/pfe-20221231.htm) [9]; [Pfizer 2023 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800324000039/pfe-20231231.htm) [8]; [Moderna FY2021 results](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2022/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/) [11]; [Moderna 2022 10‑K](https://annual-statements.com/company/moderna-inc/annual-report-2022-form-10k-4617) [12]; [Moderna FY2023 results](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2023-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx) [13]; [Moderna FY2024 results](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2024-Financial-Results-and-Provides-Business-Updates/default.aspx) [14]; [AstraZeneca 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901832/000110465922025720/azn-20211231xex15d1.htm) [15]; [AstraZeneca 2022](https://www.research-tree.com/newsfeed/article/astrazeneca-plc-final-results-1705538) [16]; [J&J 2021 Axios](https://www.axios.com/2021/10/19/johnson-johnson-q3-covid-vaccine-sales) [17]; [Sinovac 2021 sales](https://www.sinovac.com/en-us/news/id-3111) [18]; [Pfizer 2024 guidance](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-provides-full-year-2024-guidance/) [72].
- COVAX shipped ≈1.98B doses cumulatively by end‑2023 (≈1.0B in 2021, ≈0.85B in 2022), underpinning LMIC access as supply loosened after late‑2021 [Gavi knowledge product](https://www.gavi.org/news-resources/knowledge-products/learning-covid-19-support-vaccine-delivery-during-future-health-emergencies) [19].
- Demand phases: The market moved from (1) mass primary series in 2021 to (2) booster/“bivalent” Omicron updates in late 2022 and (3) annual monovalent JN.1/KP.2/LP.8.1 formulas in 2023–2025, with eligibility focusing on older and medically vulnerable populations in HICs [FDA updated mRNA actions](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-action-updated-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-better-protect-against-currently-circulating) [23]; [EMA ETF JN.1 2024/25](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/etf-recommends-updating-covid-19-vaccines-target-new-jn1-variant) [39]; [FDA 2025–26 formula](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/covid-19-vaccines-2025-2026-formula-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2025) [37]; [WHO TAG‑CO‑VAC May 2025](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2025-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines) [38].
- Outlook: From 2025 onward, demand is seasonal, risk‑group–focused, and procured publicly in the EU (e.g., HERA multi‑year framework with Moderna) vs. commercial in the U.S. (list/private prices ≈$137–$142/dose; coverage via Medicare and ACA‑mandated preventive services) [EC/HERA–Moderna JPA](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/commission-signs-joint-procurement-contract-covid-19-vaccines-ensure-preparedness-and-continued-2025-01-24_en) [75]; [CDC price list (arch.)](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/2024/2024-12-01.html) [68]; [CMS Medicare vaccine pricing](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/part-b-drugs/vaccine-pricing) [69]; [ACA §2713](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-13) [70].

## 1) Market size, growth, and dose volumes (2021–2025)

### 1.1 Administered dose volumes (annual)
- Global administered doses (annual, from OWID “World” cumulative series) dropped dramatically after 2022. Method: annual total = end‑of‑year cumulative doses – prior end‑of‑year cumulative [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1]; [OWID dataset documentation](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccination-dataset) [2].
- Anchors for the post‑2022 low base:
  - EU/EEA administered ≈31.3M doses in Sep 1, 2023–Jul 31, 2024 (2023–24 “season”) [ECDC 2023–24 report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5].
  - U.S. 2024–25 season: ≈27.6M pharmacy + ≈3.2M medical office doses administered by Apr 12, 2025 (≈30.8M) [CDC COVIDVaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html) [6].

These anchors corroborate OWID’s global annual increments shrinking from billions (2021–2022) to a few hundred million (2023–2024) as programs focused on high‑risk groups [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1].

## 4) Geographic and income distribution (administered doses; 2021–2025)
- Aggregation approach: country‑year sums from OWID mapped to WHO regions and World Bank FY2025 income groups; regional/income shares can be reproduced with the linked datasets [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1]; [WHO vaccines dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/vaccines) [3]; [World Bank groups](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) [4].
- LMIC access expanded via COVAX in 2021–2022 (≈1.98B cumulative shipments), with PAHO alone delivering 100M doses to LAC by mid‑Feb 2022 [Gavi knowledge product](https://www.gavi.org/news-resources/knowledge-products/learning-covid-19-support-vaccine-delivery-during-future-health-emergencies) [19]; [PAHO milestone](https://www.paho.org/en/news/15-2-2022-paho-delivers-100-million-covax-vaccine-doses-latin-america-and-caribbean) [20].
- Post‑2022, HICs administered relatively small seasonal volumes concentrated in older adults (EU 2023–24 ≈31.3M; U.S. 2024–25 ≈30.8M by mid‑April 2025), consistent with risk‑group targeting [ECDC 2023–24](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5]; [CDC COVIDVaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html) [6].

## 5) Procurement, pricing, and channel shifts

### 5.1 United States (commercial market since late 2023)
- Transition: Procurement moved from federal to commercial channels beginning 2H 2023; seasonality dominated thereafter [Pfizer 2023 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800324000039/pfe-20231231.htm) [8].
- Prices and coverage:
  - Private‑sector list prices (adult presentations, 2024–25): Comirnaty ≈$136.75; Spikevax ≈$141.80 per dose (actual net prices lower) [CDC price list (arch.)](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/2024/2024-12-01.html) [68].
  - Medicare Part B covers COVID‑19 vaccines; CMS publishes product allowances and administration payments [CMS](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/part-b-drugs/vaccine-pricing) [69].
  - ACA §2713 requires non‑grandfathered commercial plans to cover ACIP‑recommended immunizations without cost sharing [ACA §2713](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-13) [70].
  - The federal “Bridge Access Program” for uninsured ended Aug 2024; coverage now varies by state/manufacturer programs [CDC Bridge (arch.)](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/programs/bridge/index.html) [71].

### 5.2 European Union and other regions (public procurement)
- EU: HERA signed a 4‑year joint procurement with Moderna for up to 146M doses (17 participating countries), with flexibility and an emphasis on prefilled syringes—underscoring continued public procurement for risk‑group campaigns [EC/HERA–Moderna](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/commission-signs-joint-procurement-contract-covid-19-vaccines-ensure-preparedness-and-continued-2025-01-24_en) [75].
- EU–Pfizer/BioNTech deliveries were rephased and reduced via a 2023 amendment, smoothing volumes through 2026 [BioNTech investors](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/pfizer-and-biontech-provide-update-covid-19-vaccine-supply) [76].

## 6) Outlook beyond 2025: scenarios, product pipelines, capacity

### 6.1 Demand outlook (2026–2030)
- Risk‑group focus persists. U.S. adult uptake for 2024–25 remained near 20–23% overall, higher in ≥65; EU older‑adult seasonal coverage similarly modest—supporting low‑to‑moderate annual demand absent variant surges or combination‑vaccine convenience gains [CDC COVIDVaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html) [6]; [ECDC 2023–24](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5].
- Policy cadence: WHO SAGE maintains 6–12‑month revaccination for high‑priority groups; U.S. ACIP 2024–25 added an extra dose for ≥65 and immunocompromised; UK JCVI narrowed eligibility in 2025 [CDC ACIP EtR](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/evidence-to-recommendations/covid-19-2024-2025-additional-dose.html) [75]; [UK JCVI 2025](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccination-in-2025-and-spring-2026-jcvi-advice/jcvi-statement-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-2025-and-spring-2026) [34].
- Behavior: KFF polling showed most U.S. adults did not plan to receive a 2024 fall shot, highlighting persistent hesitancy and convenience barriers that cap demand [KFF poll](https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-while-most-adults-do-not-expect-to-get-a-covid-19-shot-this-fall-those-who-want-one-worry-about-access-and-insurance-coverage/) [77].

Illustrative scenarios (global doses per year):
- Base: 400–600M doses globally, concentrated in ≥60s and high‑risk, consistent with EU/US seasonal coverage and WHO SAGE cadence [ECDC 2023–24](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5]; [CDC ACIP EtR](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/evidence-to-recommendations/covid-19-2024-2025-additional-dose.html) [75].
- High (variant surge + broader eligibility): 600–850M, with peaks near 0.9–1.1B if severe drift occurs, guided by WHO TAG‑CO‑VAC/EMA ETF annual composition updates [WHO TAG‑CO‑VAC](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2025-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines) [38]; [EMA LP.8.1](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/etf-recommends-updating-covid-19-vaccines-target-new-lp81-variant) [39].
- Low (policy narrowing + low willingness): 250–390M.

### 6.2 Pricing and procurement (medium‑term)
- U.S.: Seasonal, retail‑driven sales at list/reference prices ≈$137–$142/dose (lower net) with Medicare and commercial coverage tied to ACIP; uninsured access depends on state/manufacturer support [CDC price list](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/2024/2024-12-01.html) [68]; [CMS](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/part-b-drugs/vaccine-pricing) [69]; [ACA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300gg-13) [70]; [CDC provider program](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html/) [73].
- EU: Public tenders (e.g., HERA framework) maintain lower, confidential prices and supply security for risk‑group campaigns [EC/HERA–Moderna](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/commission-signs-joint-procurement-contract-covid-19-vaccines-ensure-preparedness-and-continued-2025-01-24_en) [75].

### 6.3 Product pipelines and competition
- Annual composition: U.S. VRBPAC and EMA ETF expect yearly updates (2025–26: LP.8.1 preference) [FDA 2025–26 formula](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/covid-19-vaccines-2025-2026-formula-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2025) [37]; [EMA LP.8.1](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/etf-recommends-updating-covid-19-vaccines-target-new-lp81-variant) [39].
- Combination vaccines:
  - Moderna mRNA‑1083 (COVID+influenza) showed positive Phase 3 results; BLA timeline adjusted to include contemporaneous flu efficacy; potential U.S. approval in 2026 [Moderna mRNA‑1083](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Announces-Positive-Phase-3-Data-for-Combination-Vaccine-Against-Influenza-and-COVID-19-/default.aspx) [78]; [Moderna BLA update](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Provides-Update-on-BLA-Submission-for-Combination-Vaccine-Against-Influenza-and-COVID-19/default.aspx) [79].
  - Pfizer–BioNTech combo missed non‑inferiority vs influenza B in Phase 3; program iterating [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-biontech-say-combined-flu-covid-vaccine-misses-main-goal-phase-3-trial-2024-08-16/) [80].
  - Sanofi–Novavax: co‑exclusive licensing to co‑commercialize COVID vaccine and develop non‑mRNA combos; FDA Fast Track granted to flu+COVID combinations [Novavax–Sanofi](https://www.novavax.com/press-releases/2024-05-10-Novavax-and-Sanofi-Announce-Co-exclusive-Licensing-Agreement-to-Co-commercialize-COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Develop-Novel-COVID-19-Influenza-Combination-Vaccines) [81]; [Sanofi Fast Track](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2024/2024-12-11-06-00-00-2995072) [82].
- Platform and capacity strategy:
  - Sovereign mRNA hubs to support seasonal updates: UK (MHRA MIA for Moderna Harwell), Canada (Health Canada DEL for Laval), Australia (Melbourne facility up to 100M doses/year) [Harwell MIA](https://www.harwellcampus.com/modernas-uk-manufacturing-facility-receives-manufacturing-licence-from-the-mhra/) [84]; [Health Canada DEL](https://news.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Modernas-Canadian-Manufacturing-Facility-Receives-Drug-Establishment-License-From-Health-Canada/default.aspx) [85]; [Victoria DJSIR](https://djsir.vic.gov.au/news-and-articles/new-moderna-facility-opens) [86].
  - Network optimization continues as COVID‑only capacity is repurposed (e.g., BioNTech 2025 network optimization; Novavax CZ site sale) [Reuters BioNTech](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biontech-guides-worse-than-expected-2025-revenue-decline-2025-03-10/) [90]; [Novavax CZ sale](https://ir.novavax.com/uk/press-releases/2024-12-04-Novavax-Announces-Sale-of-Czech-Republic-Manufacturing-Site-to-Novo-Nordisk-for-200-Million) [89].

## 7) Methods, estimation notes, and reproducibility
- Administered doses (global and by geography): annual totals are reproducible by summing OWID “new_vaccinations” by country and calendar year, mapped to WHO regions and World Bank income groups; global totals equal the difference in OWID “World” cumulative series at each year‑end [OWID CSV](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) [1]; [WHO dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/vaccines) [3]; [World Bank groups](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups) [4].
- Delivered doses: COVAX annual shipments and cumulative totals from Gavi knowledge product; regional milestones from PAHO; EU 2023–24 administered season and U.S. 2024–25 seasonal uptake provide additional validation for the low‑volume endemic era [Gavi](https://www.gavi.org/news-resources/knowledge-products/learning-covid-19-support-vaccine-delivery-during-future-health-emergencies) [19]; [PAHO](https://www.paho.org/en/news/15-2-2022-paho-delivers-100-million-covax-vaccine-doses-latin-america-and-caribbean) [20]; [ECDC 2023–24](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/covid-19-vaccination-coverage-eueea-during-2023-24-season-campaigns) [5]; [CDC COVIDVaxView](https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html) [6].
- Revenues: company‑reported annual product sales are taken directly from SEC filings and official investor communications; Pfizer Comirnaty revenue is used as the alliance proxy; BioNTech profit‑share is excluded to avoid double counting; where suppliers did not publish figures (e.g., CNBG), the report refrains from asserting quantified revenues beyond documented lower bounds from disclosing peers [Pfizer 2022 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800323000024/pfe-20221231.htm) [9]; [Pfizer 2023 10‑K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78003/000007800324000039/pfe-20231231.htm) [8]; [Moderna 2022 10‑K](https://annual-statements.com/company/moderna-inc/annual-report-2022-form-10k-4617) [12]; [AstraZeneca 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901832/000110465922025720/azn-20211231xex15d1.htm) [15]; [Sinovac 2021](https://www.sinovac.com/en-us/news/id-3111) [18].
