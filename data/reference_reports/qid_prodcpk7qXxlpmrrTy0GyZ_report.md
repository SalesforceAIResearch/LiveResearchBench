# U.S. Desktop CPU Market (Aug–Sep 2025) — Price Snapshot, Availability, and What’s Missing to Conclude Performance/Value Rankings

## Executive Summary
- This report captures first‑party U.S. retail street prices (Amazon, Best Buy, Micro Center; Walmart only when Walmart.com is the seller of record) for AMD Ryzen 7000/9000 and Intel 14th Gen/Arrow Lake‑S “Core Ultra K” CPUs in mid‑September 2025, with timestamps and direct product links. Marketplace/third‑party offers are excluded. Prices often vary by store (especially Micro Center) and can be in‑store only; details are noted per SKU with links to the exact pages used for verification [1][2][4][5][7][8][9][10][12][13][14][15][16][18][19][20][21][22][24][25].  
- AMD official store (SEP/MSRP) and Intel ARK RCP references are included to distinguish MSRP/SEP from street prices [28][29][49][50][51][52][31][33][61].  
- No August 2025 gaming or productivity benchmark sets were captured in the provided material. Without per‑title FPS (1440p/4K), 1%/0.1% lows, productivity scores/timings, power, thermals, and complete test‑bench disclosures from reputable 2025 reviews, it is not possible to make evidence‑based performance or value rankings across gaming, creator workloads, efficiency, or thermals for this lineup. The sections titled “What’s missing to finalize rankings” outline the exact data and sources required to complete the analysis using August 2025‑current results.

## CPUs Covered
- AMD: Ryzen 9 9950X3D, 9900X3D, 9800X3D, 9950X, 9900X, 9700X, 9600X [1][2][4][5][7][8][9][10][12][13][14][15].  
- Intel: Core Ultra 9 285K, Core Ultra 7 265K, Core Ultra 5 245K (Arrow Lake‑S), plus Core i9‑14900K/KS, i7‑14700K, i5‑14600K (Raptor Lake Refresh) [16][18][19][20][21][22][24][25][47][48].

## Street Prices by Retailer (captured Sep 16, 2025, U.S. Eastern Time)
Notes:  
- Prices are recorded only when the retailer itself is the seller of record (e.g., “Sold by Best Buy,” “Ships from and sold by Amazon.com”). Many Amazon and Walmart pages default to marketplace sellers; those are excluded. Micro Center prices are typically in‑store only and vary by store; PDPs or store‑filtered search/category pages are cited as observed [1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][24][25].  
- AMD store and Intel ARK links provide MSRP/SEP or RCP (not street price) [28][29][49][50][51][52][31][33][61].

## Retailer/Seller‑of‑Record and Availability Notes
- Best Buy PDPs used here show Best Buy as seller of record and display the price or sold‑out status at capture; prices in this report come from those PDPs [2][4][7][9][12][14][18][19][20][24][44][47][48].  
- Micro Center prices are commonly in‑store only, vary by store, and may require store selection or member sign‑in to reveal the price on the PDP; where PDPs hid price, store/category listings were used as references to display public price ranges [1][5][8][10][13][15][16][22][35][40][42][43][54].  
- Amazon prices are recorded only when “Ships from and sold by Amazon.com” is visible in the buy box; example first‑party listings for i9‑14900K and i7‑14700K are included here [21][55].  
- Walmart often surfaces marketplace sellers for these CPUs; entries without “Sold and shipped by Walmart.com” were excluded from pricing (reference links are included only to illustrate marketplace context) [3][6][11][17].

## Observed Price Positioning (street vs SEP/RCP)
- AMD “X3D” gaming‑oriented SKUs are pricing at or below AMD store SEP at major retailers: 9950X3D Best Buy $699 (equals AMD SEP $699); Micro Center as low as $639 in‑store [2][29][1]. 9900X3D Best Buy $599 (equals AMD SEP $599); Micro Center in‑store promos lower at some stores [4][49][35]. 9800X3D Best Buy $479 (equals AMD SEP $479); Micro Center store prices sometimes lower [7][28][5][37].  
- Non‑X3D Ryzen 9000s trend meaningfully lower at Micro Center vs. Best Buy and AMD Store “Now” prices: e.g., 9950X $519.99 in‑store vs. Best Buy $599.99 and AMD Store “Now $599” [8][9][50]. 9900X as low as $339.99–$359.99 in‑store vs. Best Buy $469 and AMD Store “Now $469” [10][12][51]. 9700X at $289.99–$299.99 in‑store vs. Best Buy $329 and AMD Store “Now $329” [13][14][52]. 9600X ~ $179.99 in‑store vs. Best Buy $229 and AMD Store “Now $229” [43][44][51].  
- Intel Arrow Lake‑S K‑series is mixed: Ultra 9 285K Best Buy $619.99 vs. Micro Center $529.99 in‑store and Intel ARK RCP $599; Best Buy was sold out at one capture variant, indicating volatility [18][46][16][31].  
- Legacy Intel 14th Gen shows aggressive in‑store pricing: i9‑14900K $399.99–$409.99 in‑store (Micro Center) vs. Best Buy $499.99 and Amazon $413.64 first‑party [22][24][21]. The i9‑14900KS remains premium at $649.99 in‑store [25].

## What’s Missing To Finalize Performance and Value Rankings
To determine “best” by gaming (1440p/4K), productivity (Premiere/Resolve, Blender/Cinebench, code compiles), power efficiency, thermals, and overall value, the following 2025‑current evidence is needed from primary benchmarking outlets with fully disclosed methods and August 2025‑current patches/BIOS/Windows builds:
- Gaming at native 2560×1440 and 3840×2160 with per‑title average FPS and 1%/0.1% lows across a representative 2025 suite (e.g., Cyberpunk 2077 2.0/PL, Alan Wake 2, Starfield, F1 24, Forza Motorsport 2023, Horizon Forbidden West, Baldur’s Gate 3, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwarts Legacy, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Cities: Skylines II, Star Wars Outlaws; esports like CS2, Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Rainbow Six Siege). Exact settings, versions, and whether native vs. DLSS/XeSS/FSR (and mode) must be specified for each title to ensure apples‑to‑apples results. Target outlets: TechPowerUp, GamersNexus, Hardware Unboxed/TechSpot, ComputerBase, Digital Foundry, Tom’s Hardware (August 2025‑dated charts).  
- Productivity:  
  - Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio (PugetBench or fixed projects), with app versions, project parameters, and score/elapsed time metrics.  
  - 3D rendering: Blender (official benchmark projects) and Cinebench R24/R23 scores, including sustained runs to expose thermal throttling.  
  - Code compilation: Chromium/LLVM/Linux kernel builds with toolchain versions, repo revisions, and exact build flags; wall‑clock timings.  
  - Live streaming: OBS Studio (x264 and AV1 where applicable) with encoder presets, bitrates, game overlay scenes, capture method, and encode FPS/drops plus in‑game FPS impact.  
- Power and efficiency: CPU package power and/or system‑at‑the‑wall during standardized gaming and productivity loads, with performance‑per‑watt calculations and explicit platform power limits (AMD PPT/TDC/EDC; Intel PL1/PL2) and measurement points.  
- Thermals: peak and sustained CPU temperatures and any throttling under long‑duration renders or stress workloads, including cooler model, fan curve, ambient, case airflow, and paste; stock settings only with EXPO/XMP applied.  
- Full test bench disclosure: GPU and driver version, RAM capacity/speed/timings, motherboard model and BIOS/AGESA/microcode, Windows 11 build (preferably 24H2 for Arrow Lake scheduling), storage, and cooling.

Without these 2025‑current, per‑title and per‑workload results, any performance or value ranking would be speculative.

## Practical Buying Guidance (Price‑Only Context)
- If shopping primarily on price today:  
  - Best “in‑store deal” cluster: Ryzen 9 9900X at $339.99–$359.99 (Micro Center) is far below both Best Buy and AMD Store “Now” pricing; likewise Ryzen 7 9700X at $289.99–$299.99 and Ryzen 5 9600X around $179.99 in‑store are unusually low for new‑gen parts [10][12][51][13][14][52][43][44][51].  
  - If preferring online purchase from a national retailer, X3D parts track AMD SEP closely at Best Buy (9950X3D $699, 9900X3D $599, 9800X3D $479), while non‑X3D parts carry higher online premiums vs. in‑store Micro Center [2][4][7][29][49][28][9][12][14].  
  - For Intel, the i9‑14900K typically sits ~$400 in‑store (Micro Center) versus ~$500 at Best Buy and ~$414 at Amazon first‑party; the 14900KS remains a high‑price specialty SKU [22][24][21][25]. Ultra 9 285K is notably cheaper in‑store (~$529.99) vs. Best Buy ($619.99) and near Intel’s $599 RCP [16][18][31].

## Important Caveats
- Prices fluctuate quickly and, for Micro Center, vary by store and are often in‑store only; verify availability and local price on the linked PDP or store page before purchase [1][5][8][10][13][15][16][22][40][42][43][54].  
- Amazon and Walmart frequently default to marketplace sellers; this report only records first‑party listings (Amazon.com or Walmart.com as seller of record). Marketplace links are included only as context and were excluded from price calculations [3][6][11][17][21][55].
