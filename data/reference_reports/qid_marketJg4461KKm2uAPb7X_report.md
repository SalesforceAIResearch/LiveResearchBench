# Global Cryptocurrency Exchange Market (Jan 1, 2024 – Aug 31, 2025): Regulatory Environment, Compliance, and Competitive Implications

## Executive Summary
- Across Jan 2024–Aug 2025, the regulatory perimeter for centralized exchanges (CEXs) materially tightened in the EU as MiCA’s issuer rules took effect on June 30, 2024 and full CASP obligations applied from December 30, 2024, including conduct, custody/segregation, and market‑abuse surveillance requirements for crypto‑asset service providers. [27] [31]  
- Hong Kong’s virtual‑asset platform regime finished its transitional period on June 1, 2024, after which only licensed or “deemed‑to‑be‑licensed” VATPs could operate, with retail derivatives access restricted and strong token‑admission, custody, and surveillance controls required. [74] [68] [75]  
- Singapore brought expanded DPT activities into scope from April 4, 2024, added user‑protection and trust‑account safeguarding measures, and imposed updated AML/Travel Rule obligations via Notice PSN02, with transitional deadlines for newly scoped activities. [43] [51] [52] [53] [45]  
- Japan continued strict segregation/audit oversight for registered exchanges and updated Travel Rule counterpart‑jurisdiction lists through June 25, 2025, requiring operational adjustments ahead of an August 1, 2025 effective date for the latest change. [79] [83] [82]  
- South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act came into effect on July 19, 2024, mandating segregation, bank custody of deposits, insurance/mutual‑aid, and prohibitions on unfair trading practices with strengthened monitoring and reporting expectations. [87] [91]  

These differences drove exchange strategy on listings, derivatives availability, staking, custody models, and licensing footprints, especially for Binance (subject to a U.S. monitorship), Coinbase (public U.S. entity with ongoing disclosures and litigation developments), and platforms serving Asia hubs (HK, SG, JP, KR). [8] [10] [13] [74] [43] [79] [87]  

Note: This report prioritizes rigorously sourced regulatory and compliance developments across the U.S., EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, and maps their implications for exchange operations and competitive strategy, consistent with the sourcing requirements. [1] [27] [43] [74] [79] [87]  

## Scope, Definitions, and Measurement Approach
- Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are custodial platforms that intermediate user trades and hold client assets under licensing regimes where applicable, such as New York’s BitLicense in the U.S., VATP licensing in Hong Kong, and CASP authorization under MiCA in the EU. [1] [74] [27]  
- Derivatives venues serving U.S. users require CFTC registration (e.g., as DCM/SEF) for futures and swaps; retail commodity transactions with leverage are also within CEA scope. [14] [16] [2]  
- Travel Rule/AML supervision applied across jurisdictions, including BSA applicability in the U.S., EU TFR from Dec 30, 2024, MAS PSN02 (Apr 2024), Japan FSA Travel Rule updates, and Korea’s AML and user‑protection requirements. [21] [38] [45] [82] [87]  

Methodological notes for market metrics:
- When compiling monthly spot vs. derivatives volumes and market shares, reputable providers with transparent methodologies should be cross‑checked (e.g., independent observed‑trade datasets vs. exchange‑reported data), and definitions should clarify perpetuals vs. dated futures and notional vs. turnover. (This requirement flows from the brief’s sourcing standard and standard supervisory concerns about wash trading and market integrity under MiCA and state guidance.) [31] [24]  

## Regulatory and Compliance Environment (Jan 2024–Aug 2025)

### United States
- Licensing/registration: No federal exchange license for spot crypto; exchanges typically register as MSBs with FinCEN and obtain state money‑transmitter licenses, with New York requiring a BitLicense or limited‑purpose trust charter. [1]  
- Derivatives registration: Futures/swaps or margined retail commodity transactions trigger CEA registration (DCM/SEF/FCM) or exclusion; enforcement actions against offshore platforms emphasize the perimeter. [2] [14] [16]  
- Securities perimeter: Activities involving “crypto asset securities” implicate SEC registration or exemptions (e.g., exchange/ATS/broker‑dealer/clearing agency), with enforcement against staking/brokerage arrangements illustrating application. [3]  
- AML/Travel Rule: The BSA Travel Rule at 31 CFR 1010.410 applies to MSBs; FinCEN proposed threshold changes and clarified obligations for CVC/digital assets in 2019 guidance and 2020 NPRMs. [21] [4] [5] [18]  
- NYDFS program: Enhanced coin‑listing/delisting governance (Nov 2023), custody segregation guidance (Jan 2023), and market‑manipulation guidance (2018) applied to BitLicensees throughout 2024–2025. [19] [20] [24]  
- Notable actions:  
  - KuCoin indicted (Mar 26, 2024) and later pled guilty with near‑$300m penalties in 2025; CFTC filed parallel civil action. [6] [2] [7]  
  - Binance reached a coordinated U.S. resolution (Nov 2023) with a five‑year monitorship; plea approved Feb 23, 2024. [8] [9] [10]  
  - OKX pled guilty to AML violations and agreed to >$500m penalties (Feb 24, 2025). [23]  
  - SEC v. Consensys (filed Jun 28, 2024) relating to MetaMask staking/swaps; dismissal entered Mar 27, 2025. [3] [11] [22]  
  - Coinbase litigation developments were reflected in SEC press and company filings during the period. [12] [13]  

Compliance barriers: Fragmented state licensing, high‑bar NYDFS expectations (capital/surety, custody segregation, coin‑listing governance), banking access, and SEC/CFTC perimeter uncertainty for staking/derivatives. [1] [19] [20] [2]  

### European Union
- MiCA: Titles III–IV for stablecoins (ARTs/EMTs) applied from June 30, 2024; full CASP regime applied from December 30, 2024, introducing authorization, conduct, custody/segregation, and market‑abuse regimes for CASPs. [27] [28]  
- Market integrity: ESMA released its “last policy documents” on Dec 17, 2024 and supervisory guidelines to prevent market abuse under MiCA on Apr 29, 2025. [31] [32]  
- Reverse solicitation: ESMA issued guidelines restricting third‑country access via reverse solicitation under MiCA. [33]  
- Travel Rule: EU TFR (Reg. 2023/1113) applies from Dec 30, 2024; EBA issued Travel Rule Guidelines to harmonize AML/CFT implementation across CASPs. [38] [30]  
- EBA/EU supervisory packages: EBA published MiCA regulatory products and AML/CFT supervision guidance for CASPs during 2024. [35] [36]  

Compliance barriers: Substantial substance/governance requirements for CASPs, tight outsourcing rules, and narrow reverse‑solicitation pathway raise the bar for non‑EU platforms serving EU clients. [31] [33]  

### Singapore
- Licensing: Digital Payment Token (DPT) service providers require licensing under the Payment Services Act (PSA) as Major or Standard Payment Institutions, with the MAS Financial Institutions Directory listing licensees. [39]  
- Scope expansion: April 4, 2024 commencement expanded PSA scope to DPT custody, non‑custodial facilitation, and certain cross‑border transfers, while introducing user‑protection measures with transitional timelines (30‑day notification, 6‑month license application, 9‑month external audit attestation). [43] [51] [52] [53]  
- AML: MAS Notice PSN02 (revised Apr 2, 2024; effective Apr 4, 2024) updated AML/CFT obligations for DPTSPs including Travel Rule expectations. [45]  
- Custody/segregation: Trust‑account safeguarding and segregation rules applied on a staged basis from Apr 4, 2024. [46] [47]  
- MAS signaled a high bar for firms serving overseas customers without local servicing. [50]  

Compliance barriers: Newly captured activities (custody/facilitation) must meet licensing and user‑protection controls, including safeguarding, disclosures, and auditor attestations under tight transitional timelines. [43] [51] [52] [53]  

### Hong Kong
- VATP regime: The non‑contravention period ended June 1, 2024; only licensed or deemed VATPs could continue to operate, subject to strict custody, token‑admission, insurance/compensation, and surveillance requirements. [74] [61] [75]  
- Retail derivatives access: The SFC has repeatedly warned that unlicensed VA futures/derivatives to retail are unlawful and VATPs generally may not offer such products to retail. [68]  
- Stablecoins: Consultation conclusions issued July 17, 2024; the stablecoin ordinance passed May 21, 2025; regime and guidelines effective Aug 1, 2025 with transitional provisions. [64] [65] [66] [78]  
- Enforcement/alerts: SFC added multiple offshore platforms to its Alert List in 2024 (e.g., Bybit and MEXC), signaling perimeter enforcement. [70] [71]  

Compliance barriers: Local substance, governance, insurance/compensation arrangements, token‑admission committee requirements, surveillance tooling, and retail product restrictions shape product scope and listing strategies. [75] [68]  

### Japan
- Registration: Crypto‑asset Exchange Service Providers (CAESPs) must register under the PSA; derivatives fall under the FIEA with strict segregation, audits, and AML/CFT obligations. [79]  
- Travel Rule: Japan expanded Travel Rule counterpart‑jurisdiction lists in April and June 2025, with latest changes effective Aug 1, 2025. [81] [82]  
- Supervision: Administrative actions (e.g., against DMM Bitcoin) emphasized systems and controls after a May 2024 outflow; warnings also covered unregistered operations and asset‑retention orders for FTX Japan. [83] [84] [85]  

Compliance barriers: Robust segregation, cybersecurity, and AML/CFT requirements, coupled with evolving Travel Rule alignment, require continuous operational updates by exchanges. [83] [82]  

### South Korea
- Virtual Asset User Protection Act: Effective July 19, 2024, the Act enforces segregation, bank custody of fiat deposits, insurance/mutual‑aid, and prohibits manipulation, fraud, and MNPI misuse, with monitoring and reporting obligations for VASPs. [87] [91]  
- Implementation: Enforcement Decree effective July 19, 2024 set methods/procedures; authorities outlined an inspection and investigation pipeline for unfair trading. [88] [92]  

Compliance barriers: Insurance/mutual‑aid, record‑keeping, suspicious‑trading monitoring, and periodic token‑listing reviews (as discussed in contemporaneous coverage) increase compliance costs and scrutiny. [87] [90]  

## User Segmentation: Retail vs. Institutional vs. Cross‑border Payments (Definitions and Proxies)
- Retail segment: Individual consumers trading via UI or mobile apps; regulators’ consumer‑protection oriented regimes (e.g., HK VATP restrictions for retail derivatives and EU CASP conduct rules) imply this segment requires heightened guardrails and disclosures. [68] [31]  
- Institutional segment: Professional or accredited clients, often trading via API/OMS connectivity, prime brokerage, and custody, with regulatory frameworks focusing on market‑abuse controls and robust governance (e.g., ESMA market‑abuse guidelines and CASP governance rules). [32] [31]  
- Cross‑border payments users: Entities using DPT transfer services (on‑chain and off‑chain) subject to Travel Rule and AML/CFT obligations under U.S. BSA, EU TFR, MAS PSN02, Japan Travel Rule, and Korea AML frameworks. [21] [38] [45] [82] [87]  

Measurement proxies under regulatory regimes:
- Trade‑size distributions and API vs. UI usage are typical proxies for retail vs. institutional mix; public disclosures (e.g., Coinbase 10‑Q categorizing transaction revenue/volume by consumer vs. institutional) provide segment anchors. [13]  
- Travel Rule compliance metrics (e.g., coverage of counterpart‑jurisdictions and VASP‑to‑VASP message success rates) proxy cross‑border payments activity, especially where regulators periodically update jurisdiction lists. [82]  

## Comparative Compliance and Offering Profiles: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and FTX (historical baseline)

Note: The following focuses on compliance track records, licensing posture, and flagship offerings as evidenced in official regulatory and company filings/releases within the period; historical FTX references are limited to official supervisory records in Japan within the window.

### Coinbase
- Public disclosures: Coinbase’s SEC filings (e.g., Q1 2024 10‑Q) categorize transaction revenue and volumes by consumer vs. institutional and discuss litigation developments, offering visibility into segment contribution and risk. [13]  
- U.S. litigation developments: The SEC announced case developments regarding Coinbase during the period. [12]  
- Offerings and controls: Coinbase’s relevance to U.S. perimeter issues (staking, brokerage questions) should be assessed in light of SEC enforcement stances (e.g., Consensys matter for staking/swaps) and U.S. registration expectations for securities/derivatives, although those actions were not directed at Coinbase in the cited releases. [3] [14] [16]  

### Binance
- U.S. monitorship and penalties: U.S. Treasury/OFAC/CFTC resolution announced Nov 21, 2023 imposed a multi‑year monitorship and substantial penalties, with court approval on Feb 23, 2024, shaping product, onboarding, and sanctions/AML controls. [8] [9] [10]  
- Strategic implications: Monitorship conditions typically drive enhancements to AML, sanctions, and market‑integrity programs across global operations, with repercussions for U.S.‑person access and product scope. [8]  

### Kraken
- Regulatory posture: Kraken’s operations in the U.S. and abroad are shaped by the same U.S. state/federal perimeters, EU MiCA CASP rules, and Asian licensing frameworks; the applicable obligations for derivatives and staking are governed by the cited U.S./EU/Asia regimes. [2] [31] [43] [74] [79] [87]  

### FTX (historical benchmark reference within period via Japan orders)
- Japan supervisory actions: The FSA maintained asset‑retention orders for FTX Japan through June 2024, providing an official record of ongoing supervisory constraints for the erstwhile platform’s local entity. [85]  

## Product Availability and Competitive Strategy by Geography (Implications for Exchanges)

### United States
- Product perimeter: U.S. CFTC registration is required for crypto derivatives offered to U.S. persons, with enforcement against unregistered offshore platforms serving U.S. users; staking/brokerage functions risk SEC jurisdiction if involving “crypto asset securities.” [2] [14] [16] [3]  
- Strategy implications: Many global exchanges restrict or geofence U.S. users from derivatives and certain tokens, or operate via separately registered entities, to align with CEA and securities‑law risk. [2] [14] [16] [3]  

### European Union
- CASP obligations: MiCA imposes authorization, conduct, custody/segregation, and market‑abuse surveillance rules, increasing the compliance burden for listing governance, asset‑segregation, and supervision of trading behaviors. [27] [31] [32]  
- Third‑country access: ESMA’s reverse‑solicitation guidelines restrict availability to EU clients without full authorization, pushing exchanges toward local licensing rather than passive cross‑border models. [33]  

### Singapore
- Expanded scope: New PSA coverage captures DPT custody and non‑custodial facilitation, with safeguarding and user‑protection measures shaping custody models, disclosures, and platform governance. [43] [51] [53]  
- Strategy implications: Exchanges seeking a hub in Singapore need substantial compliance infrastructure (AML/Travel Rule, safeguarding, audit attestations), which influences the feasibility of certain yield/staking and derivatives features. [45] [46]  

### Hong Kong
- VATP licensing: Strong token‑admission, custody, insurance/compensation, and market‑abuse surveillance requirements constrain retail product menus and listing breadth; retail derivatives access is generally not permitted via VATPs. [75] [68]  
- Strategy implications: Exchanges choosing HK must accept a narrower retail product set, higher compliance costs, and strict operational governance, while gaining access to an internationally recognized regulatory framework. [74] [75]  

### Japan
- Segregation/audit and Travel Rule alignment: Registered CAESPs must maintain strict asset‑segregation and AML/CFT controls with periodic Travel Rule updates requiring operational changes; administrative actions signal low tolerance for control failures. [79] [82] [83]  
- Strategy implications: Listings and leverage are conservative, with high operational resilience and cybersecurity expectations due to supervisory emphasis post‑incident. [83]  

### South Korea
- User‑protection and market‑abuse prohibitions: The Act mandates segregation, bank‑held deposits, and insurance/mutual‑aid, while imposing anti‑manipulation and MNPI prohibitions with enhanced monitoring and reporting. [87] [91]  
- Strategy implications: Domestic exchanges must implement strong surveillance and token‑review processes, with periodic reviews discussed in industry coverage, shaping listing life cycles and liquidity. [90] [87]  

## Key Cross‑Jurisdictional Themes Affecting Exchanges
- Travel Rule Convergence: EU TFR application from Dec 30, 2024 and MAS PSN02 updates, alongside Japan’s jurisdiction‑list changes and Korea’s AML frameworks, push exchanges to harmonize VASP‑to‑VASP data‑sharing and screening controls across regions. [38] [45] [82] [87]  
- Market‑Abuse Surveillance: ESMA’s MiCA market‑abuse guidelines and HK VATP surveillance expectations drive investments in alerting, STOR processes, and market‑integrity tooling. [32] [75]  
- Custody and Segregation: MiCA CASP rules, MAS safeguarding, Japan PSA segregation, and Korea bank custody/insurance requirements converge on stronger custodial segregation and disclosure practices. [27] [46] [83] [87]  
- Retail Derivatives Restrictions: HK’s continuing stance on retail access to VA derivatives and U.S. CFTC registration expectations limit cross‑border availability of leverage products to retail. [68] [2]  

## Enforcement and Risk Landscape (Jan 2024–Aug 2025)
- High‑profile U.S. actions against KuCoin and OKX emphasize AML/registration obligations for offshore platforms serving U.S. customers. [6] [2] [23]  
- Binance’s U.S. plea and monitorship reflect sanctions/AML remediation at scale with court oversight. [8] [10]  
- Japan’s administrative actions (e.g., DMM Bitcoin) underscore cyber and control rigor, with FTX Japan subject to continued asset‑retention directives within the period. [83] [85]  
- Hong Kong’s Alert List additions and public warnings highlight ongoing perimeter enforcement and product‑risk communications. [70] [71] [77]  

## Data Requirements and Limitations for Market Sizing and User‑Segment Quantification
- To publish monthly spot and derivatives volumes, market shares by exchange, regional distributions (U.S., EU, Asia), and asset‑category splits (BTC, ETH, stablecoins, altcoins), a cross‑verified dataset using independent trade capture is required, with wash‑trading adjustments and standardized instrument taxonomy (perpetual vs. dated futures; options) to align with supervisors’ market‑integrity focus. [31] [24]  
- For user‑segment quantification, exchange disclosures by segment (e.g., Coinbase consumer vs. institutional transaction revenue/volume) and proxies like API vs. UI usage, trade‑size distributions, and Chainalysis‑style on‑chain flow classifications are appropriate, subject to reconciliation with Travel Rule flows and AML reporting regimes. [13] [38] [45]  

## Conclusion
Divergent but converging regulatory regimes across the U.S., EU, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea have materially reshaped exchange operations between Jan 2024 and Aug 2025, particularly on custody/segregation, market‑abuse surveillance, Travel Rule compliance, token‑listing governance, and retail derivatives access, thereby influencing product availability, geographic licensing footprints, and institutional vs. retail targeting strategies. [27] [31] [43] [74] [79] [87]
