# GDPR enforcement analysis: EU fines over €10 million (1 Jan 2022–16 Sep 2025)

## Executive summary
- Dataset: 16 GDPR enforcement decisions by EU data protection authorities with fines greater than €10,000,000, decided between 2022‑01‑01 and 2025‑09‑16, drawn from official DPA notices and decisions (Ireland, Netherlands, France, Italy, Greece). Each decision and amount is sourced directly from the competent authority’s page and, where relevant, supplemented by EDPB items or reputable press for appeals/status. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]
- Most frequent violation types in these >€10m cases (article‑grounded, with counts from this dataset):
  1) Transparency (Arts. 12–14) – 9 decisions [3][8][9][13][18][23][24][31][18]  
  2) Lawfulness/legal basis (Art. 6) – 7 decisions [4][8][8][13][24][29][31]  
  3) Fairness principle (Art. 5(1)(a)) – 5 decisions [4][8][8][13][31]  
  4) Data protection by design/default (Art. 25) – 4 decisions [4][6][9][26]  
  5) International transfers (Chapter V, esp. Art. 46) – 3 decisions [1][18][21]  
  6) Security/TOMs (Art. 32; integrity/confidentiality Art. 5(1)(f)) – 3 decisions [11][15][26]  
  7) Data‑subject rights (Arts. 15–17) – 3 decisions [23][24][31]  
  8) Breach notification/documentation (Arts. 33–34) – 2 decisions [11][15]  
  9) Accountability (Art. 24) – 2 decisions [4][26]  
  10) EU representative (Art. 27) – 2 decisions [29][31]  
  Method note: a single case can raise multiple violations; counts reflect the number of decisions in which each category appears (see the linked official sources for each decision).  
- “Typical penalty range” per violation type (based only on the fines of the decisions contributing to that category in this >€10m dataset; interquartile range IQR plus min–max; list of contributing cases under each category in section “Penalty ranges by violation type”). We clarify where the sample size is small. [1][3][4][6][8][9][11][13][15][18][21][23][24][26][29][31][33]

## Scope, sources, and method
- Scope: EU Member State GDPR enforcement decisions (not ePrivacy‑only) imposing fines greater than €10,000,000 between 2022‑01‑01 and 2025‑09‑16; each included case is supported by an official DPA page/decision. [1][3][6][8][11][13][15][18][21][23][24][26][29][31]
- Primary sourcing: national DPA press releases and decision pages (Ireland DPC; Netherlands AP; France CNIL; Italy Garante; Greece HDPA). EDPB news and binding decision materials are used as neutral corroboration. Reputable press is used only where the authority has not provided appeal/status information. [1][2][3][5][6][7][8][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]
- Fine‑setting context: supervisory authorities apply the GDPR’s Article 83 framework; the EDPB’s final Guidelines 04/2022 describe a harmonized five‑step methodology (categorization, seriousness, turnover, aggravating/mitigating, legal maxima; effectiveness, proportionality, deterrence). This is cited for background and does not determine the calculated ranges in this report. [33]
- Analytical method for “typical range”: for each violation type, the sample consists of all >€10m cases in this dataset that include that article(s). We compute the interquartile range (IQR: Q1–Q3) of the observed fines and also show min–max; where n<4, we report min–max and median and flag the limitation. Each figure is derived solely from the listed decisions under that category. [1][3][4][6][8][9][11][13][15][18][21][23][24][26][29][31]

## Top 10 violation types (plain‑language descriptions mapped to GDPR)
- Transparency (Arts. 12–14): clear, accessible, timely information on what data is collected, for what purposes, legal bases, recipients, and transfers, presented in an understandable way to the intended audience. Example cases: Instagram children decision (IE) with transparency shortcomings [3][4]; DPC’s Jan 2023 Meta ads decisions cite transparency issues [8]; TikTok 2023 children decision includes transparency concerns [9]; LinkedIn 2024 includes transparency articles [13]; Criteo 2023 cites transparency duties [23]; Clearview FR and GR include transparency/rights provisions [24][31]; TikTok 2025 transfer decision includes Art. 13(1)(f). [18] The WP29/EDPB Transparency Guidelines provide the core standard. [34]
- Lawfulness/legal basis (Art. 6): every processing operation must rely on a valid legal basis; mis‑using “contract necessity” or relying on invalid consent are common failures. Examples: DPC’s Jan 2023 Meta ads (contract not an appropriate basis for behavioral ads) [8]; LinkedIn 2024 lack of valid lawful basis [13]; Instagram children decision includes Art. 6(1) [4]; Clearview FR/IT/GR found unlawful processing [24][29][31]. The EDPB Targeting Guidelines and Consent Guidelines provide legal‑basis expectations. [44][36]
- Fairness principle (Art. 5(1)(a)): processing must be fair and not exploit users’ expectations or asymmetries (including children). Examples: Instagram (fairness issues) [4]; DPC Jan 2023 Meta ads [8]; LinkedIn 2024 [13]; HDPA Clearview GR cites fairness (Art. 5(1)(a)). [31] The EDPB dark‑patterns guidance links interface design to fairness/transparency. [35]
- Data protection by design and by default (Art. 25): controllers must build appropriate safeguards into systems and default settings. Examples: Facebook “data scraping” features lacked adequate design/default measures (€265m) [6]; TikTok 2023 default public settings for minors [9]; Instagram children defaults [4]; Garante Enel includes Art. 25 duties in its security/governance failings. [26][28]
- International transfers (Chapter V; Arts. 44, 46, 49): transfers must ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection (e.g., SCCs plus effective supplementary measures). Examples: Meta €1.2bn transfers to the U.S. [1]; TikTok €530m transfers to China, plus transparency on transfers [18]; Dutch AP €290m Uber transfers to the U.S. [21][22]. The EDPB Recommendations 01/2020 and Binding Decision 1/2023 elaborate expectations. [37][39]
- Security of processing and integrity/confidentiality (Art. 32; Art. 5(1)(f)): appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security, including access controls and credential handling. Examples: DPC €91m Meta password storage/security [11]; DPC €251m Meta token breach security issues [15][16]; Garante €79.1m Enel security/governance failings. [26][28] EDPB breach guidance sets security/notification expectations. [40]
- Data‑subject rights handling (Arts. 15–17): responding to access/erasure requests effectively and within statutory timelines, and providing necessary information. Examples: CNIL Criteo (Arts. 15, 17) [23]; CNIL Clearview FR (Arts. 12, 15, 17) [24]; HDPA Clearview GR (Arts. 12, 14, 15). [31] WP29 portability and transparency guidance are relevant for operationalizing rights. [47][34]
- Breach notification/documentation (Arts. 33–34): timely notification to the authority, communication to data subjects where required, and internal breach register. Examples: DPC €91m Meta (Arts. 33(1), 33(5)) [11]; DPC €251m Meta token breach (Arts. 33(3), 33(5)). [15] EDPB Guidelines 9/2022 and breach examples clarify thresholds and documentation. [40][41]
- Accountability (Art. 24): ability to demonstrate compliance (policies, controls, audits). Examples: Instagram children includes Art. 24 [4]; Garante Enel references controller responsibilities under Art. 24. [26][28]
- EU representative (Art. 27): non‑EU controllers offering goods/services or monitoring in the EU must designate an EU representative. Examples: Clearview IT fine includes Art. 27 [29]; HDPA Clearview GR includes Art. 27. [31]

## Penalty ranges by violation type (based on this >€10m dataset)
Method: for each category below, the range is computed only from the listed decisions in that category; figures are in EUR millions. Where sample size n<4, we report min–max and median and note the limitation. All case amounts are drawn from the linked authority pages. [1][3][6][8][9][11][13][15][18][21][23][24][26][29][31]

Interpretation note: very large outliers in international transfer and major ad‑tech/social‑media decisions drive wide IQRs; these reflect the turn‑over‑linked and seriousness‑based fining approach under Article 83 and EDPB Guidelines 04/2022. [33]

## Concrete compliance gaps to avoid (with case and guidance anchors)
- Third‑country transfers without effective supplementary measures: do not rely on SCCs alone where destination law undermines protections; conduct and document transfer risk assessments and implement effective technical measures (e.g., encryption with keys under EU control). Anchors: DPC Meta €1.2bn (Chapter V failings) [1]; EDPB Recommendations 01/2020 (supplementary measures and local law assessment) [37]; EDPB Binding Decision 1/2023 (Meta transfers) [38][39].
- Behavioral advertising without a valid legal basis and inadequate transparency: avoid treating targeted ads as “contract necessity” under Art. 6(1)(b); ensure clear, layered notices and, where consent is chosen, that it meets the EDPB standard. Anchors: DPC Jan 2023 Meta ads (lawfulness and transparency failings) [8]; EDPB Guidelines 8/2020 (targeting roles/bases) [44]; WP29/EDPB Transparency Guidelines (Articles 12–14) [34].
- Children’s settings and features not privacy‑protective by default: avoid public‑by‑default for minors, risky default messaging features, and confusing disclosures; perform a DPIA and apply age‑appropriate design choices. Anchors: DPC TikTok €345m (defaults/transparency for minors) [9]; DPC Children’s “Fundamentals” (child‑oriented design/default expectations) [45][46]; WP29 DPIA Guidance (high‑risk triggers and Art. 35) [42].
- Security basics (password storage, access tokens, vendor access) and breach documentation: prohibit plaintext/legacy insecure storage, ensure robust access controls and vendor oversight, document all incidents and notify within 72 hours where required. Anchors: DPC Meta €91m (password storage/security; Arts. 32, 33) [11]; DPC Meta €251m token breach (Arts. 33(3), 33(5)) [15][16]; EDPB breach notification guidance and examples [40][41].
- Data protection by design/default and platform features that facilitate scraping or over‑exposure: harden discovery and contact‑importer features, implement rate‑limits/anti‑enumeration controls, and produce design reviews evidencing Art. 25 compliance. Anchors: DPC €265m Meta scraping (Art. 25) [6]; EDPB “deceptive design patterns” guidance for social media (design/default linked to fairness and transparency) [35].
- Consent in ad‑tech flows: ensure there is verifiable, prior, freely given consent for targeted advertising that relies on Art. 6(1)(a), with an easy withdrawal mechanism and full transparency on partners/controllers. Anchors: CNIL Criteo €40m (consent validity, withdrawal, transparency, joint controllership) [23]; EDPB Consent Guidelines (freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous; withdrawal) [36].
- Controller accountability, processor oversight and agent/vendor risk in telemarketing and customer databases: implement strong access governance and Article 28 processor controls; monitor agent activities; maintain an auditable compliance program. Anchors: Garante Enel €79.1m (security/governance/control gaps) [26][28]; EDPB Controller/Processor Guidelines 07/2020 (roles, Article 28 contracts, allocation of responsibilities) [43].
- EU representative for non‑EU controllers targeting/monitoring in the EU: designate an EU representative and cooperate with DPAs; lack of representation can be sanctioned alongside other violations. Anchors: Garante Clearview IT (Art. 27) [29]; HDPA Clearview GR (Art. 27) [31].
- Rights operations and user tooling: ensure timely and comprehensive responses to access/erasure requests and clear self‑service options; design notices and flows that support rights. Anchors: CNIL Criteo (Arts. 15, 17) [23]; CNIL Clearview FR (Arts. 12, 15, 17) [24]; WP29 Portability Guidelines [47]; WP29/EDPB Transparency Guidelines [34].
- Transparency on international transfers in privacy notices: clearly disclose destinations, safeguards, and how to obtain copies (Art. 13(1)(f)/14(1)(f)). Anchors: DPC TikTok €530m (transparency on transfers) [18]; WP29/EDPB Transparency Guidelines [34].

## How the top issues show up in practice (with cross‑references)
- International transfers: Three very large fines (Meta €1.2bn; TikTok €530m; Uber €290m) show regulators scrutinizing post‑Schrems II safeguards and transparency on transfers, often imposing suspension orders and corrective measures. [1][18][21][22][37][39]
- Ad‑tech and behavioral advertising: Four large decisions (Instagram children €405m; Meta ads Facebook €210m; Meta ads Instagram €180m; LinkedIn €310m) center on legal basis (rejecting contract necessity), fairness, and transparency—themes reinforced by the EDPB’s Targeting and Transparency guidelines. [3][4][8][13][44][34]
- Design/default and children’s protections: TikTok €345m and Instagram €405m stress privacy‑protective defaults for minors and clear disclosures; the DPC’s Children’s “Fundamentals” highlight expectations that SAs have cited in supervision and enforcement. [9][4][45][46]
- Security and breach handling: Meta €251m (token breach), Meta €91m (password storage/security), and Enel €79.1m (access/governance) emphasize both preventive controls and correct notification/documentation, consistent with EDPB breach guidelines. [15][11][26][40][41]

## Limitations and assumptions
- Some authorities publish press summaries without the full decision or exhaustive article mapping; where article numbers are not in the authority’s page, reputable secondary sources are used and clearly cited (e.g., GDPRhub for specific article mapping in Enel). [26][28]
- Small samples in several categories (e.g., international transfers n=3; breach notification n=2) limit statistical characterization; ranges are descriptive of this dataset only and should not be generalized to all enforcement. Each range is traceable to the listed cases and amounts. [1][15][18][21]
